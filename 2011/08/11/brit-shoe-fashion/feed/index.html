		<description><![CDATA[If I make the (poor) decision to wear billion inch heels, I am committed to it for the entire night, even if it means crawling home with bloody stumps for feet.

(Actually, the sky high heels (4-5&quot;) are way more comfortable than my lower work heels (~3&quot;), because they have a platform which cushion my feet and make the angle not so bad. Unfortunately 5&quot; platform heels are not appropriate for the office.)

Why don&#039;t they just carry those roll-up flats with them?]]></description>
