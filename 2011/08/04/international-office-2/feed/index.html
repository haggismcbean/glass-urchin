		<description><![CDATA[@Myddrin - Have u lived in and dealt with many different countries? I have, and based on my experience things get done with more efficiency and quicker in the US. In one country (which shall remain namless) I was sent to 4 different offices (which were in 2 different towns) to get a paper stamped 4 times so that I can purchase an airline ticket...in another country my whole family had to wait 1 year to get a visa... and yet in another, our family had to wait 20 yrs. before we were allowed to travel outside of the country!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Myddrin - I did ask with email like 20 times, also that&#039;s what the page just before was about.  :P  They didn&#039;t respond until I met them in person.  And if it&#039;s such an easy question, I wonder why they didn&#039;t just tell me straight away!

I do think some things get done in the US with more efficiency than here IMO]]></description>
