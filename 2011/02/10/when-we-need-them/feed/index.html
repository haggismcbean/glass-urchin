		<description><![CDATA[YAY!  Thank you! :3 I&#039;ve found kittehs are better than Xanax, too. 

^ Used to have HORRIBLE panic attacks.

There may be some science behind it.  I don&#039;t have the permission/money to unlock the specific article that cites it [Peter J. Jarvis (1990). Urban Cats as Pests and Pets. Environmental Conservation, 17, pp 169-171], but in the quotes I&#039;ve been able to procure through other means states that stroking a purring cat lowers blood pressure.  

SO KEEP PETTIN&#039; THAT KITTEH!

And encourage its boxcat cuteness.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello, 
You don&#039;t know me but, I&#039;ve been reading your comic for like since um let&#039;s see . . . 2009ish during a time where I was going through some real deep shit. I mean the kind of stuff people hear about after finding a body drifting in the SF Bay right under the crimson metal of Golden Gate Bridge. 

I don&#039;t know you but I do know one thing: 

What your cat does for you, you have done from me. 

You little characters, your insightful autobiographical rants, your journey through love and lost, and see you grow as an artist everything that you have shared in your webcomic has helped me each and everyday.

So please, know that you are precious, that you are strong, and that whatever it is that is making you feel any less than perfect (even that little critic voice in the back of your head) is dead wrong. Tell all that negativity to go fuck off, look yourself in the mirror and say I AM AMI AND I KICK  ASS! 

Oh and as for the whole singlehood stuff: you&#039;ll find your hottie sooner or later. Guys nowadays requiring the women to hunt. Go forth and hunt. Take some of your fellow amazons with you. A good wing girl can make all the difference. 
And always remember to get contact info! :p 
I do that too. ;) So no big.

You&#039;ll get through this and you are very much loved.

All the best,
poet2012.
