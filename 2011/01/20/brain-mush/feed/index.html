		<description><![CDATA[I basically agree...  I think it&#039;s sort of a taboo to be smart in this country and if you&#039;re above &quot;average&quot; intellect you&#039;re often viewed as &quot;elite&quot; or something unattainable like that.  And we laugh and bring out our ignorance like they&#039;re funny jokes and not something to take seriously.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it has a lot to do with increase of positive reinforcement for idiotic behavior. We live in a society where: intellectualism is seen as detached and arrogant, art is perceived as a hobby and not a legitimate job, and culture is nothing more than a begrudging task if your dating someone who likes going to museums.]]></description>
