... just to take away one minor misconception, you are going to Scotland. You will not understand a word :), but it will be an awful lot of fun listening to them. It&#039;s like a foreign language ... and eventually you will go native and everyone back home will look at you strangely when you talk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know this sounds cheesy, and since I&#039;m only a reader of this comic I hope this isn&#039;t out of order. But You made those friends for a reason, you must be a wonderful person. They&#039;ll be there for you always and this might be an opportunity to make more friends. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll do wonderfully!]]></description>
