She was scary and made us learn latin, she was also old and hung out with Mrs. Fanning I think...  Mrs. Fanning made us watch Sound of Music and sing along all the songs every time though.

Well if only...  Well why don&#039;t I try this!&quot; and then would pray and would magically start to jump rope.]]></description>
