		<description><![CDATA[First time commenter long time reader here. =)

Censoring your emotional output in a medium used to healthily express all those kinds of negative feelings is a silly thing IMO. I can&#039;t speak for those more intimately connected to you, but as upsetting as some things you write about may be, its better for them to be expressed and hopefully relieved than not.

On that note, I&#039;ve probably nodded my head solemnly or understood exactly what you were saying in an unhappy comic as often as I have laughed at a joyful one. You have a way of expressing yourself and emotion that is pretty powerful.]]></description>
