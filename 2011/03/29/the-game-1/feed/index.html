		<description><![CDATA[the book has its merits.  if you pick through all of the rubbish of &#039;there is a trick to it&#039; and layers and layers of zig-zag story you find a book that tells you, &quot;people like some things and dont like others - do those things that people like&quot;- things like smile more often, groom yourself, get better at talking to strangers, remember people&#039;s names, say funny things sometimes, be intelligent, dont be a fat shlob...  learn a bit of a musical instrument...  be creative, have something interesting to talk about...

when you break it down - its anything that everyone kinda knows - the book kinda just Reminds you - to be attractive to others - you need to be attractive...  and it works - for people who need to be told to groom themselves - it tells them.  you might also take some advice from the book Auilix?  anyone kinda can.   

if people interpret the book wrong - or arent good enough - you get pseudo-creeps who arent good at being nice.  which is a crying shame.

personally the book reminded me that little details are important and all add up to being a friendly welcoming person.]]></description>
