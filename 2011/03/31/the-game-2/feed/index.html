		<description><![CDATA[@Eliot I agree with you. Communication is the most important skill in our lives, which is why I read the book. But as a friends dad once said to me &quot;Read these books to be as sly as a fox, but as gentle as a lamb&quot;
@Ray I&#039;d say the above statement fits what any woman should do with it. Being aware and being a critical thinker goes a long way at protecting your values. 

I actually don&#039;t have any trouble with the book itself. I have trouble with the attitude of just trying to jump into a girls pants. I have never been impressed by a 50 year old player. but a couple who&#039;s been married for 50 years and is still madly in love with each other does impress me, because they worked for that. And you don&#039;t have a girl love you for fifty years by negging her or NLP, you get love through giving love. Just wanted to clarify that XD]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really didnt think the book was that bad.  it did mention negging - and if you plan to use that as a conversation technique with other people - it probably wont work.  it might take you a while to figure out that it wont work - and then you will figure out what does work on getting people to talk with you.  and then you will be a better person.  whats that thing about the journey not the destination - you cant tell people about the journey and where the destionation is - they have to go through their own journey to figure out how to be good people and no longer be socially inept.  

in summary - neg is stupid - learning communication skills is not.  

everyone reads what they want to in a book - I think you might have read it and picked up on this part of it which might offend you - on the other hand - I might have read it and picked up on the parts that were relevant to me - idea that getting healthy, wearing nice clothes,  smiling, learning names, etc. are useful for communicating with people.

I just dont think you can criticise the whole book on a single point it says.  its also a narrative of a guys life and a story of healthy change into the future...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[it&#039;s a lifestyle choice I think, playas and such ilk. My friend who first told me about &quot;The Game,&quot; sorta typical city-hip-hop-asian, grew up on Biggie/Puff Daddy sensibilities. Anyways, he&#039;s never really had a girlfriend before, and one of his goals before turning 30 was to have a GF. haha so he did and one of the things his girl chastised him about was having a copy of this book. He&#039;s grown up in my eyes. 

My opinion? This book is a peek into their playbook. The subjects that the books target, the woman, should get together and write their own playbook, called &quot;The Game Hunter&quot; or something like that. The whole premise is to identify these individuals and then ELIMINATE THEM. Embarrass publicly. RARRR]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Though practitioners of &quot;The Game&quot; only serve to validate my reclusive tendencies; my sick, syphilitic brain actually finds some morbid amusement with them. Every time I&#039;m unfortunate enough to be sitting near some cheese dick attempting to woo the opposite sex, I laugh at how their courtship habits and pick up lines parallel that of Beavis and Butthead.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a psych major, and an all around gentleman, so when I first read The Game I wanted to throttle every person inside it. With everything I could say about The Game, I will say that it&#039;s honestly not that impressive if you get a girl into bed with you. It is, however, impressive to me if you fall in love with a girl, commit to her, and give your entire life to making her happy. The first is selfish, and requires you to be made of slime. The second is scary, and requires an act of faith and courage. A real man does the courageous thing, and doesn&#039;t do anything to lower the self worth of a woman.]]></description>
