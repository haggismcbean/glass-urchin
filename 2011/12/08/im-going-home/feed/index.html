		<description><![CDATA[@Auilix - I&#039;m confused by the large numbers of Brits on the PATH train too, most of them sound like they&#039;re from London...perhaps they miss the tube :D 

For the most part it&#039;s been good fun - excluding the Earthquakes, Hurricanes and protesters! I&#039;ve been following the comic for a while and I found the &quot;You Don&#039;t Say&quot; posts most useful when talking about courgettes - Thanks!

Safe travels home - (only 8 more days for me!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Tom - Wow, so you basically did the opposite of what I did then!  Hope you&#039;re enjoying the US. 
Actually, I&#039;ve always wondered why there seems to be a lot of British people on the PATH train in the morning commute...
Also - don&#039;t go to Howell, it&#039;s not worth it just for pictures :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know exactly how you feel.  I&#039;m from the UK and I&#039;ve spent the last 6 months in Jersey City.  Just remember your family and friends are waiting for you - so make the most of them when you can!  I would offer to visit Howell and take some photos for you, but Google Maps is telling me it would take 3 hours by public transport :(]]></description>
