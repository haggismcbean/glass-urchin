		<description><![CDATA[Well it is somewhat strange. Depending on uni you get marks raised up or down. In Aberdeen for instance it was not rare to get 70+ (I even got a 99 once), while in Edinburgh it was less often (67 is my dissertation mark... 70 was distinction...).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification

Scroll down half under midway until you get to the score mapping. When I was at uni that classification chart was used to measure that quality of the work assessed. If we got 70+ for *any* assessment, it meant we had completed work that was the equivalent to attaining an First, which showed you were the best of the best, the few of the few. You getting a 63 shows you were 7 off to being, uh, well, Delta Force, I guess.]]></description>
