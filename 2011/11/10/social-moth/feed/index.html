		<description><![CDATA[@Auilix, you&#039;ll find if you cross the border, the further south you go, the stiffer people get when meeting new people, and the more likely people are to keep to the people they know. You go as far as Kent, and anti/unsocial *there* means &quot;I maybe go out with friends once a week. If I have the time.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i think anti or unsocial here means something different. it appears to mean &quot;i only go out with friends three days a week as opposed to every single day&quot;, and I think that would qualify a lot of people i know back at home as anti social.  

besides 4 people does not equal &quot;a whole bunch&quot;]]></description>
