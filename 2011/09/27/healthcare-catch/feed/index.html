		<description><![CDATA[Aye, you pay taxes as everyone does in most places. We just don&#039;t funnel quite so much of it towards bombing other countries. Most folk (the rich too) use the NHS for serious healthcare, as it&#039;s timely and great service. &#039;Tis only cosmetic surgery and the like where private is preferred. 

@bree we keep ye all around for yer cute fingerpainting ;&gt;

@auilix loving the scots adventure, hope Embra&#039;s treating you well.]]></description>
