		<description><![CDATA[Dunno, I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve seen american stuff that throws lots of slang in. 

I&#039;m just saying there&#039;s a difference between what is thought of as traditional slang, that doesn&#039;t get used much, and everday stuff that people use without really thinking about it....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Frankie - the ones I heard I heard at a pub quiz here that wasn&#039;t International or American themed and the girl was English so I can only assume it was true.  

For the record, I don&#039;t think Americans know anything at all about British rhyming slang, I would be surprised if any of my friends even know the apples and pears one.  Isn&#039;t that one just used as an example to explain it?]]></description>

Never heard of cooking fat before. Only ones I can think of now are Harris and Taking the Michael....]]></description>
