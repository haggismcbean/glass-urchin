		<description><![CDATA[HAHA. Reminds me of my favorite episode of Family Guy when Brian dates the older lady.

Rita: [after breaking up with Brian] You can leave my apartment key on the davenport.
Brian: [about to set them on the dresser] Here?
Rita: No. The davenport- the chesterfield.
Brian: [about to set them on the cushioned bench] On this?
Rita: No. Does that look like a divan to you?
Brian: [about to set them on the windowsill] Here?
Rita: [sighs] Leave them on the chifferobe.
Brian: [crossly] You know what? Just take your fucking keys because I don&#039;t know what the fuck you&#039;re talking about. [slams door]]]></description>
