		<description><![CDATA[@Pingu - I&#039;ve tried Irn Bru and I could almost feel my teeth falling out as I drank it.  

@Frankie D - right but they also weren&#039;t sure when I ordered a 7 &amp; 7, which I feel is a fairly common drink in the US.  Since they also don&#039;t have Seagram&#039;s 7, I think they were just plain confused.  Also, I think you can say cream cheese, just that a couple of times I&#039;ve been asked if I&#039;d meant creamy/spreadable cheese (like brie or camembert), which is definitely not what I&#039;d call &quot;cream cheese&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On the topic of lemonade, I thought I&#039;d bring in an Australian opinion for added confusion:
lemonade is any clear soft drink (soda water is not lemonade, 7up is a lemonade)
lemon squash is any (usually yellow) lemon-flavoured soft drink (mountain dew is kind of a lemon squash, it&#039;s got lime in it too though)
The American style stuff is more like a cordial, but we still call it lemonade.

We also call both fries and crisps &quot;chips&quot;, for added confusion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, 7Up is a brand of soft drink, not lemonade. Doesn&#039;t 7up have lime added as well?

Weirdly, it&#039;s the same for the cheese. Philadelphia is a brand of cream cheese, so saying cream cheese should work, but then, you are up north....


Shandy is a mix of beer and lemonade. A &quot;&quot; top is a pint of &quot;&quot; with a dash of lemonade.]]></description>
