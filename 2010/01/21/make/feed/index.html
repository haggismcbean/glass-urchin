		<description><![CDATA[I hope you&#039;re doing okay, Ami. I whole-heartedly agree with Kusandha&#039;s comment!

Also, I miss you! If you need a drinking partner or just someone to let off steam with let me know. We can argue about USA vs. Europe or something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Darren, you&#039;re always so knowledgeable.  

I know, that quote is just one of those things you say when you&#039;re depressed.  It&#039;s really the first time the end was brought into my mind seriously, although we&#039;re not at that point yet just the sheer thought of an abrupt and sudden departure was sad and sort of bittersweet. 

But we&#039;re also mature (uhh... despite how we are most of the rest of the time) dudes so we&#039;ll work it out.  Or try anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No, good things don&#039;t have to end. That&#039;s a silly saying, if there ever was one.
Kendra and I have been together for 10 years, come this February. We&#039;ve got a little dern on the way.
My parents will have been married 37 years come this year.
Saturday Night Live is still on the air.
You can still ride Space Mountain at either Disney World or Disneyland.
Roses will still bloom this spring.
Trust me, good things can stay forever.
It&#039;s sad when a good thing does end. But don&#039;t end a good thing just because you think it has to.]]></description>
