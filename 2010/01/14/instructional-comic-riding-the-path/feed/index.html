		<description><![CDATA[RANT ALERT!: Don&#039;t put ANYTHING on the seat next to you unless your area is pretty clear. This goes for buses as well - which I ride/rode often (mostly Rutgers and NJ Transit). Nobody wants to sit next to you either, but if crowds don&#039;t make it possible for everyone to have their own space, don&#039;t be an asshole with your purse/shopping bag/briefcase...also, on a side note, you shouldn&#039;t have a briefcase. It&#039;s PUBLIC transportation and the option to sit next to you should exist. Once the bus gets moving and people have stopped looking for seats, then you can do whatever you want with that spot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree - the old PATH cars get a little crazy between Pavonia and Christopher, and those dangly, moveable handlebars don&#039;t do much to help.  I have trouble staying on myself (I&#039;m a girl, but i&#039;m over 5&#039;7&quot;), and I often wonder how older people or handicapped people manage to hang on.  Then again, I saw an older lader CROCHETING (aka not using the handlebars at all) the entire time from 23rd to Grove St.  Props to her (she bumped into me a lot, but I didn&#039;t mind cause I thought it was amusing how she could not put her knitting needles down for a beat)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that folks need to move in but there must be a difference in the way the PATH is laid out vs the subway (although the new cars seem to solve some of this problem). I notice that shorter people (mostly women) have a much more difficult time riding PATH especially on the 33rd street line between Christopher &amp; Hoboken/JSQ when the train speeds up &amp; takes turns pretty quickly. I observe many guys moving into make room (although many don&#039;t) but short women really get the brunt of this crazy 10 minute balancing act. It seems like the cars are designed for people 5&#039;7&quot; and up. Many women are not this tall.]]></description>
