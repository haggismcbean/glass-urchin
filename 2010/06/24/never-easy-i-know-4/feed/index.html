		<description><![CDATA[Aww... hon... how long were you in the new apartment together?

I was told by several wise friends that the first 2 weeks-1month of moving in together with someone you love, you both should not take whatever you say to each other to heart.  Sometimes it takes less time, sometimes more.

My boyfriend and I, after over 3 years of awesome (and sometimes not so awesome) togetherness.  It has been a rough couple weeks, but things are just now starting to get better.

Oddly, very oddly, enough, it took one of my seizures to make that jump, both with my boyfriend and my roommate.  It may get better, it may not, but that is the advice I have for you.]]></description>
