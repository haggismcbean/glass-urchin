		<description><![CDATA[Well it&#039;s definitely good to get a breather, but it depends on what kind of person you are - you might be very happy on your own or it could be a little lonely!  Either way, good luck with everything!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I currently live with a family. I do work, however, and I do earn a decent income &gt;.&lt;. Thing is, I&#039;m just looking to find my own place soon (life without siblings and parents). Sorry for asking you such a question here XD!

but thank you so much &lt;3!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ted - I like living in an apartment, but I suppose it depends on what you like!  Like if you have a couple of friends to go in with who can be in other rooms or whatever.  I only lived on my own in a studio walkup once, and it was pretty lonely.  For most of my apartments in Jersey City, I was able to be about 1/4th my monthly salary for rent, which I guess is what you should do.  The studio was a little bit of a splurge, but it was good to move location and kinda take a rest from roomies for a while.]]></description>
