		<description><![CDATA[And if you&#039;ve got a certain Moogle in your party, you get a free Yeti.

PS - I know it&#039;s been hard, but thank you for pouring your emotions into the art. It&#039;s been some of your most powerful, gripping work to date. I hope that it&#039;s been in some way cathartic. If it has, please; keep going.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If life is like a video game, then this is hardly even the midpoint.

It&#039;s not the end of your world, merely a big change: You&#039;ll wake up and dust yourself off... and Sure you&#039;ll have to catch Cid a bunch of fish (which gets annoying), but when you&#039;re ready you&#039;ll go out on that raft and most everyone will still be around. Then you&#039;ll realize the real adventure will be just beginning: Plus you&#039;ll get a much cooler airship, and a relic that stops random encounters: So it&#039;s not all bad!]]></description>
