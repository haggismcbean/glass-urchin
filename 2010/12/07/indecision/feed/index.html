		<description><![CDATA[@all - I&#039;m pretty set on my decision (moving) but I&#039;m still trying to keep within the budget I set out to.  I think I can do both!

@Kus - taking the train from JC is only an hour more a day, which I don&#039;t think is that bad.  It&#039;s the $300 cost of commuting that kills me, but if I can find a cheap place in Grove I think it would be worth it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed - happiness is far more important. There&#039;s a friend of mine and my sister&#039;s who&#039;s working over as a civilian contractor at the Navy Yard in Philly, but lives wayyy out on the edge of Manayunk (about half an hour away with a good commute) with a bunch of farmland and cows, and has regretted the decision ever since. 

Seriously, Ames, live in the city and have fun and stuffs. You deserve fun. Saving money&#039;s important, but there&#039;re ways to effectively do so that don&#039;t involve living near rednecks.]]></description>
