		<description><![CDATA[Greetings from a brazilian fan!

Every single one of your comic strips make my day a little better. Everytime. Even the &quot;sad&quot; ones.
Don&#039;t ever let go. Find strength on you friends, family, pets, under that beautiful tree that you cross every day... Who knows what you will find? Pain is inevitable, but we do not need to choose suffering.
And Merry Christmas!

[]s, Kil.]]></description>
