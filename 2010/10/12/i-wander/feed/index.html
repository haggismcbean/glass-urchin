		<description><![CDATA[Joking aside: You&#039;re deluding yourself if you really think all you need is a &quot;good man&quot;. You my friend, need love. To give love, and be thanked for that love with an equal amount of it given to you in return. I don&#039;t want to use the phrase &quot;the one&quot;, but the conditions ARE very narrowing: and prolly not even the ones you think you know (I&#039;ve been in love very few times, but it was rarely with the kind of person you&#039;d expect me to be in love with).
Some people say you can&#039;t find love if you&#039;re actively looking for it... and to an extent I agree: but to me, looking for love is like a big road trip. You know your destination, and you&#039;ll love it when you get there, but you have to learn to also enjoy the trip itself (maybe even visit a few roadside attractions, and take a detour or two): Or you&#039;ll go insane long before you get there.
Least that&#039;s MY thoughts on it, but then again: I just spent 7 panels of my comic today implying you&#039;re a furry... So I&#039;d prolly take anything I say with a grain of salt ha ha!]]></description>
