		<description><![CDATA[@Ray Really?  You definitely said I could get anyone in the bar we were at and then proceeded to tell me that you didn&#039;t approve of anyone there for me.  I think we all didn&#039;t really like the pickins there.  Colin was also sitting there and he almost did a spit take when you mentioned the hot because it was so random.  

HAVE I LEVELED UP IN HOTNESS?  :B   * makes a sexy thing dorky*]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Marcella - thanks so much for your kind words!  I&#039;m glad everything worked out for you

@Faye - I have no idea what I&#039;m comfortable with...  Who knows...  Sometimes I just think I need someone to distract me

@Foley - I have a friend who lies about it, telling new &quot;meeting&quot; stories all the time :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I attempted the online dating out here in the vast wasteland that is the Northwest. Twas not a good thing. Bleh. You&#039;re sexy, smart, talented, and funny, babe- just go out and have a good time wherever you feel most comfortable and you should run into guys that like the same stuff/feel the same way. Maybe check out MeetUp.com - at least that way you get to meet a bunch of people in general, not just dating.

Love seeing Ray Ray&#039;s character, btw! So cute! ^.^;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve commented before, but I&#039;m a long-time fan.  I just wanted to send you one note (of many I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get) saying that I met my husband through online dating six years ago.  I hadn&#039;t had any luck meeting people at work, I wasn&#039;t into meeting people at bars, and I felt like I didn&#039;t have many options to meet guys.

I put up a profile on an online site, and went on a couple of first date flops.  The guys, in each case, were nice but I just didn&#039;t click with them (or, probably, them with me).  Then I sent a note to this one guy, and we started emailing back and forth, met up a few weeks later and have had a blast together ever since.  He&#039;s charming, smart, thoughtful and attractive.

So, just wanted to say that it can and does work and is a great alternative to picking up someone in a bar, if that&#039;s not your thing.]]></description>
