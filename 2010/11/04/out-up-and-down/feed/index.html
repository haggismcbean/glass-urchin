		<description><![CDATA[@Amy  I LOVE hanging out with my good friends...  In fact they are probably one of the best things that keeps me going into full on 24-hr 7-day a week depression.  And I try not to drag them down to the dumps with me, so that&#039;s why I take short breaks of depress-i-tude alone.  

Anyway just clearing it up that I&#039;m not depressed because of my friends, I love being with them, just depression happens I guess.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re definitely not alone. I went through this for about six months a few years ago after my live-in bf broke up with me by calling me from the airport... saying he was going home (to new zealand!) and the keys were on the counter. Ouch!!!!

I did meet my husband about a year later. LOL He did me a favor, but I sure didn&#039;t see it that way then. :(]]></description>
