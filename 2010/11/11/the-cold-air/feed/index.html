		<description><![CDATA[Believe me, I understand. I recently moved up to Vermont for school. From the South East. So not only do I have the literal &#039;much colder than I have ever been used to&#039;, but my entire support system, including anyone that I could cuddle with, is gone. 

...Add to that a flair-up of the depression and anxiety issues that I have dealt with for years, and I think that it is safe to say that I understand where you are coming from.]]></description>
