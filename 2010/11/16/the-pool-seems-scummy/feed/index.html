		<description><![CDATA[I disagree that most people meet their loved ones through family and friends. these days, almost half of all relationships start online! :) I met my husband accidentally through craigslist on the &#039;friends&#039; board (or whatever it is, I don&#039;t remember anymore...) Perhaps try meeting some friends of the opposite sex. For some reason, when it&#039;s not a &quot;date&quot; people tend to be more honest and you catch their goofy side rather than the &quot;let&#039;s make love down by the fiyah, babeh!&quot; side. By the way, my husband has a master&#039;s, and dyslexia, so he isn&#039;t very good at spelling. As he says, &quot;that&#039;s what spellcheck is for!&quot; (I also hate the you&#039;re/your thing! Though my personal peeve is &quot;Glinda&#039;s Shoe&#039;s.&quot;) In email is one thing... but you PAID for that sign, flyer, business card, or magnet, at least TRY to get it right! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey let me tell you it&#039;s not a great place for us either. Ami you would be a diamond in the online dating pool. Guys have women with 3 kids and 3 baby daddies to deal with. The cheaters just like you get.. Oh and don&#039;t forget the women that want a David physique, a Trump bank account, and a doctorate education, when they barely made it out of high school.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I personally hate the people who use txt speak when they have a keyboard.  I can deal with it on a cell phone message, though I bought a Blackberry to get around using it myself, but those that insist on doing it all the time I want to put through a typing class.

Anyways, you won&#039;t see me on a dating website.  You might find my tent mate here though.  He&#039;s on several all the time.  &gt;.&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At least you can weed them out right off the bat online. It sucks when you meet a nice guy IRL and then he throws a &quot;u&quot; bomb at you later on. Or he starts texting dirty things to you like 3 texts in and your first meeting/conversation was not even remotely sexual and you barely even know each other and goddamn that&#039;s just CREEPY.

Anyway.]]></description>
