		<description><![CDATA[It probably wasn&#039;t someone acting specifically against you or the other comics that got hacked - most likely it was a worm that was propagating via security holes in WordPress, which is an extremely frequent occurrence.

Stuff like this is why I stick with Movable Type (which is designed to be much more secure from the get-go), but unfortunately it&#039;s a lot more difficult to get a site up and running with it, especially a webcomic.]]></description>
