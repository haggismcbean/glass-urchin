		<description><![CDATA[@Brian 
Thanks for your support! I guess it&#039;s all about attempting something new, at least every now and then!

@William 
For now it&#039;s just these two comics, but I plan on using it more in the future, but .  I agree, some designs are harder to use than others, being that my characters dont have mouths, fingers, or eyebrows it&#039;s pretty difficult sometime.  I&#039;ll be interjecting some people comics here and there, but it&#039;s going to continue being maiiinly critters for now.  
Good idea if I had the time or patience to do it!!  ;P  Some good comics have done the two-different-styles well though, like AppleGeeks and Onezumi.

@CyberSkull
It&#039;s critters in the next comic anyways :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i like both comics and i think your artwork is amazing :) this webcomic is one of my favorites will we see humans drawn for how long ? 4 pages ? more ? less? i like you drawn as animals but its easyer to see what the character is thinking with a human face also there is more detail in the human characters i like that cuz most times you cant see what mike is thinking too well. oh i have a idea, draw two pages per update one as human and the other as animals :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, I&#039;m all in favor of more human-styled comics, so long as you&#039;re sticking to your guns on the emotional front. (and even if you aren&#039;t? It&#039;s a nice change of pace!)]]></description>
