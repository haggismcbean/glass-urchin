		<description><![CDATA[I start flipping out when I haven&#039;t eaten in 2 hours (I am antsy before, but start going crazy at 2). I am constantly snacking at work. Rich (my SO) is just like Mike. He eats one meal and he&#039;s full the rest of the day.

As for your differences, many of them are rooted in commonness. For instance, you read different books, but you both at least read. Or your gaming habits--you grew up on different game systems, but the important thing is you both grew up on games. So you have enough similarities to be on the same page about stuff and be able to start a discussion but just enough differences to have something to talk about and keep things interesting. It works out!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha, don&#039;t worry, i bug mike for food all the time and he always says &quot;lets go get food before you get crazy&quot; (aka have a hypoglycemic attack of some sort).  It&#039;s never really a huge problem except for the times I am over mike&#039;s place and his food pantry is full of vast nothingness and i am without snacks...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought is the differences that provide the spice of life.

be careful with the food ones - dont let him force you to not eat a zillion meals a day - its about how different metabolisms work and it works differently for some people.  also dont make him eat a zillion little meals or else he will get fat o.0.

ahaha - love the comics]]></description>
