		<description><![CDATA[@Quynh - wow you&#039;re lucky nothing else got set on fire!  One time in Japan, one of my friends did the same thing in our dorm kitchen, but luckily we have electric burners and nothing caught on fire.  Close call though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Once I came home plastered and started to boil water to cook some shrimp.

I woke up the next morning to find the kitchen faucet on and the flame still on under the pot, which was burnt so badly the bottom plate on it fell off. Apparently I must&#039;ve decided right in the middle of boiling water and rinsing off the shrimp that it&#039;d be a good idea to lie down in the living room.

One of my dumbest moments. Got lucky, at least. A burnt pot is much better than a burnt down apartment building.]]></description>
