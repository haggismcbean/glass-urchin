		<description><![CDATA[Well I&#039;m just saying I&#039;m not sure how many other races in America get stuff like that.  White people think Asians are pussies, so they&#039;re not afraid to say bad stuff to us in front of our face - about asians or about other races.  My mom &amp; sis tell me countless times how people bashed blacks, gays, Jewish people right to their faces (as if mom and mel would join in), and I just dont think that happens to other races besides Asians, because white people think we&#039;re pushovers.  Mom and Mel always snap back to them annoyed retorts that make people realize we&#039;re not just going to sit here and take blatantly racist remarks.

But I do agree with you - Americans (at least in the areas I&#039;ve traveled to) know how to take it better than people in other countries.  Many places I&#039;ve been, including a bunch of places in Europe, were very confined in the way they view other races.  It&#039;s one thing I admire about America, at least we TRY to deal with properly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you misinterpreted my comment. I was responding to Ami&#039;s &quot;I wonder what goes through people’s minds when they just blurt out races like that – is it because of the Asian stereotype that we’ll just shut up and take it?&quot;

It&#039;s not because you&#039;re Asian.  It&#039;s because there are a lot of ignorant dumbasses in the world.  I&#039;m just saying the ignorant dumbasses of America are better than the ignorant dumbasses of any other country.

USA! USA! USA!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sooo, this all just goes to show you that whities really don&#039;t know what we sometimes go through. I don&#039;t often complain about how we have it and I know others have it MUCH worse (HEY! Everyone likes a nice &quot;Asians are good at math&quot; stereotype!), but when it comes right down to it - they just don&#039;t know how each little comment chips away at a once intact impression of the state of racism in this country. Aka: &quot;Hey China doll.&quot;/&quot;Are you Chinese or Japanese?&quot;/&quot;Where in China is Bulgaria?&quot;/&quot;This one&#039;s for Pearl Harbor! Right Melanie?&quot; (while toasting)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Stuart - He was more like &quot;you&#039;re.... Chinese, Japanese, something like that I dont know whatever...&quot;

I was just annoyed at saying that - was there a purpose?  What was the reason?  If you&#039;re trying to flirt with someone, don&#039;t just go yeah some race out in the orient whatevs.  Why would one do that?

At least you are a foriegner in a foreign country.  I am an American and in my own country this happens to me a lot.  To very different experience (not saying its better or worse..), that I think are just not comparable.  People here see asian people all the time so they should at least know that it&#039;s inappropriate to just blurt out that someone is Chinese/Japanese/&quot;whatever&quot;.  I don&#039;t care if they do get it right or not, it&#039;s the principle of the matter.  If a thought like that crosses your mind, just keep it to yourself!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Has nothing to do with you being Asian, and everything to do with ignorant people.  Maybe you don&#039;t remember how ignorant the Japanese are. I would say guessing nationalities is waaaaaay better than saying &quot;OMG FOREIGNERS!&quot;

It&#039;s amazing that your average ignorant dumbass in the US (or Czech Rep, it seems) can still be better than the majority of Nippon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I saw a movie once where there was a plane hijaking by (I think) Czeks and this woman from Turkey was able to talk to them sort of because of similarities in their languages.
I don&#039;t know why this made me think of it.]]></description>
