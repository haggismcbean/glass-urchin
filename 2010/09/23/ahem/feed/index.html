		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoy your comic! I&#039;ve read all of them during this last week, I just couldnt stop. :D So many of the issues and thoughts (good ones, bad ones and funny ones) that you include have hit really close to home for me. The same thing that happened with you recently happened to me at the exact same time and the way that you expressed yourself is exactly how I felt. Very amazing work :)]]></description>
