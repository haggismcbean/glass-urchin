		<description><![CDATA[My favorite Halloween &quot;matching costumes&quot; have actually been with groups of girlfriends. One year, we all went as &quot;girls with guns.&quot; I was the chick from The Matrix, another gal was the Tomb Raider chick, another was GI Jane, and one gal was Pamela Anderson Lee from Barb Wire.  We all carried squirt guns and had loads of fun!  Another year, a group of us went as Peter Pan characters.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here Here!
Being a 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc wheel to couples is one of the few things that makes me question my single status from time to time. Whereas all my married/engaged friends seem to enjoy living vicariously through me via my stories: There&#039;s no real turn around for that &quot;Ooo Ropke, tell me about how you guys sat in bed all day watching TV while she gave you a back massage&quot;... It&#039;s not quite the same.
However matching Halloween costumes are not necessarily a boyfriend/girlfriend thing. I&#039;m always up for a good idea, ooo or even better! Get a harem of 4 guys to dress up as ninja turtles and go as April O&#039;neil! Or go as Kat and have bree or someone go as Antimony: The possibilities, they are endless ha ha]]></description>
