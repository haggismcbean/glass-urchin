My tendency to relapse to children&#039;s shows comes when I&#039;m feeling irrationally afraid.  Thomas the Tank Engine is incredibly soothing at those times.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow!  Interesting story.  I guess one shouldn&#039;t steal ANYONE&#039;S car, but I would also feel especially guilty knowing it was Mr.Rogers&#039; car.  

I also like that he was religious but didn&#039;t feel the need to shove it down the throats of young children on his show.  I don&#039;t think I ever remember him talking about it, and it was nice of him to respect that children&#039;s shows probably aren&#039;t the best vehicle for stuff like that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was reading about Mr. Rogers on Wiki earlier tonight. He was one of those truly GOOD people. I mean, supposedly his car was stolen, and when that made the news, it was returned with a note that said &quot;If we&#039;d known it was yours, we would never have taken it.&quot;

He was that kind of person. 

I grew up watching &quot;Mr. Rogers&#039; Neighborhood&quot;. He is dearly loved and missed even now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I either watch a comedy to lift my spirits, or a horror, so I can say something like, &quot;I might have missed a chance to be with an awesome girl, but at least a zombie didn&#039;t shove a pitchfork through me!&quot; =D]]></description>
