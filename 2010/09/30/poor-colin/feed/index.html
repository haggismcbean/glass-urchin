		<description><![CDATA[@Foley - I didn&#039;t have a gag reaction to it because it was early on in their relationship, I just have a nauseous reaction to anytime ANYONE does cutesy romantic type things.  I wasn&#039;t trying to make a statement about the earliness of the love word or whatever, I was simply saying that Quynh and I probably react opposite to how most girls react to blatant romanticism (&quot;awww&quot;?).  
There&#039;s probably something wrong with me to that point - It makes my stomach hurt to see people do those kind of romantic things in public or in front of other people, but that&#039;s just me.  Even in movies I have a hard time watching the &quot;romance&quot; scenes... even just the plain kissing scenes. 
I know, I act like I&#039;m a 8 year old boy.  :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree wholeheartedly with this reaction.

Although happily it worked out in their case, often such quick jumps to the L word and poetically emotional waxing lead to a relationship built more on the hopelessly romantic notions (often more hopeless than romantic at this point) of one or both partners: and not on the partners themselves. Saying you love someone (or they&#039;re your soulmate, or the wo/man of you dreams, etc) before you truly know them COULD imply that you have found the perfect mate and knew so magically the moment you met them via some temporary psychic or divine understanding... but more often than not it speaks to that person&#039;s being in love, with being in love. they love the idea of love, and the other person is merely a (hopefully) accepting vessel of that platitude. Of course we all WANT to say such things at the beginning of relationships, it&#039;s the honeymoon period. We (again, hopefully) think we&#039;re in love with them... but we don&#039;t have enough empirical data to truly assess the situation. What if it&#039;s an act? What if they&#039;re actually douchebags that&#039;re just trying to get into our pants? Or even worse, if they&#039;re attempting to reinvent themselves, but their true self is destined to reassert itself within the next month or two. Heck they might be completely honest, but we haven&#039;t asked the right questions yet.

Obviously (as shown every time you see Bree and Colin), jumping to such romantic conclusions is not a death sentence for relationships. However (again, discounting temporary cosmic omniscience) it is an unnecessary gamble, and the odds are never in your favor. If I was playing poker with Colin, and he went all in before even seeing his cards: I&#039;d have a similar gut reaction (and honestly, I could easily see Colin doing just that [furthermore, given his luck in finding bree, I imagine he&#039;d win the hand somehow as well]), and that gut reaction is nothing to be apologetic for!]]></description>
