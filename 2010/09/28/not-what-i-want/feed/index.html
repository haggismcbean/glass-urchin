		<description><![CDATA[I read this one a long time ago, and I was so in love with how it related to me (I saved it on my computer), especially in the wake of when someone I loved for a very long time had hurt me in that way too (and that was in the beginning of that september).

Now it&#039;s happened again with another guy, with another set of words. I&#039;m back here at this particular comic, and somehow it helps me cope. I&#039;m feeling remarkably good since the break up, and i think it&#039;s because I&#039;m finally fighting those flashbacks and feelings by acknowledging it and positively reinforcing myself. 

Thanks and I hope you&#039;ve found your way out of it, at least soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I broke up with my guy too. I&#039;m angry at him for not doing his part to make sure we stayed connected. I mean, we&#039;re still friends, but I wonder how long even that will last.

I know how depression goes as well. But I wanna tell ya something, Ms. Ami. I found your still charming comic during a very bad time in my life, and it&#039;s one of the things that helped me cheer up, bit by bit. It does smooth out. So I&#039;ll keep reading and sending digital support until you feel better, and then I&#039;ll stick around even longer. 

That probably doesn&#039;t mean much, coming from a faceless person on the &#039;net, but I wanted to say it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sweetheart, I&#039;m going through a breakup right now too. He left me for another woman, a friend of his. He loved us both and made a choice, and he chose her. This comic really speaks to me right now, and I hope you&#039;ll be okay.

And Mextazactaces is right, you have nothing to apologise about right now. This is a hard time for you, and if depressing comics help you express that then that&#039;s good. I love reading this comic, and I&#039;ve followed it for ages. They make me smile and they make me cry, at times.

Stay strong, we&#039;re all here for you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why are you apologizing for being depressing? Oh no, how dare you be emotionally during a very trying period in your life. The reason I keep coming back to your comic is because it&#039;s relatable. There&#039;s humor, absurdity, as well as humanity.

As for your situation, I do sympathize. Regardless of how many times people comfort you and tell you how amazing you are, it&#039;s hard to believe after devastating remarks like &quot;You are not what I want.&quot;

That being said I would like to take this moment to be frank. Your comic makes me, a cynical struggler on the other side of the U.S., believe in myself. As such I believe in you. Stay strong and keep up the good work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@tiph Thanks!  Yeah, I know it&#039;ll get better.  I tell myself that a lot.  I know one day I&#039;ll just be fine!

@Chthon I know that I shouldn&#039;t worry about others.  Everyone can keep telling themselves that, but people do affect me whether I like it or not.  And when someone discards you, you can&#039;t help but wonder why.  He did like me for who I was... at one point in time.  I try not to, but I keep thinking about what went wrong, what I did to cause it.  In these situations I just don&#039;t think you can help thinking like this.]]></description>

What&#039;s most important is if you are the person you like to be.  You have to live with yourself every second of every day.]]></description>
