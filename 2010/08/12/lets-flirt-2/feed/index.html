		<description><![CDATA[Hmm... it really depends. I&#039;ve had some girls be very, VERY direct. (as in, straight up proposition me, or walk up to me and put their hand down my pants.) That doesn&#039;t work. At all.

Other girls - the more successful ones that I end up dating - are open, friendly, have a great sense of humor, are engaging to talk to, but always stay slightly out of reach. There&#039;s always a little something they&#039;re holding back, which is very intriguing. Or, they&#039;ve got some kind of creative talent... I&#039;m dating a musician right now, and hearing her sing opera is a turn on. 

As far as any advice goes, said musician and I met in the middle of the day, at a park - She saw me reading, and decided to sit down next to me. I thought I lucked out that a cute girl just happened to sit next to me, so I asked her what she was reading, and an hour later, we made plans to get breakfast the next week. 

Was it luck? Yes and no; she sat herself where she knew I&#039;d notice her, but she was walking through the park in the middle of the day, and if she&#039;d been anywhere else, we wouldn&#039;t have met.

So, basically, be you, be lucky, and be crafty...just resist the urge to go up to guys and grab them by the junk. :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Flirting is a dance and dance is about sex. --but somehow a lot of the world is still in denial about the sex--  

It&#039;s an intricate dialog of signal and response in which you and your partner obliquely discuss where to put your hands.  

There&#039;s a distinction between flirting, casual flirtation, and &quot;hitting on.&quot;  Cutting a rug on the dance floor doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re aiming for back-rubs and blowjobs any more than high-fives and handshakes.  Sometimes you just thank them for the time and move on. 

Then there&#039;s this:
Girl in bar:  &quot;Excuse me.  haha.  What are you drinking? It looks so cool!&quot;
Me: *looks at can of beer* &quot;This?&quot;
Gib: &quot;It looks so weird! I&#039;ve never seen anything like it!&quot;
Me: *looks at Gib* &quot;A Schlitz?&quot;

Flirting is truly an intricate dance.]]></description>
