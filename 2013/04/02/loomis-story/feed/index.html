		<description><![CDATA[Wow, I come up on a search for nerdy web comics? Amazing! That&#039;s one thing I love about webcomics - the ability to read them quickly and on the sly at work, it&#039;s unique to this medium. 
Thanks for reading, hope you&#039;ll be able to stick with my current schedule of sporadic updates as it is now :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To be honest, I was bored to tears at my hated but necessary job and did a search for &quot;nerdy web comics&quot; and saw a banner for yours. The name was strange to me and the art style was appealing so I clicked it and by the end of my shift, between random minuscule moments where effort on my part was actually needed, I had read all the way to the current page and was distraught that I was finally up to date. I&#039;ve related to so much of this comic that I had an uncontrollable impulse to keep reading!   :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much Dmitri, I&#039;m so happy to have inspired you! I know sometimes it&#039;s hard to pick up that pen and be creative, and sometimes the hardest part if your own self-doubts... But I&#039;m looking forward to seeing your creative work! Hang in there!
By the by, how did you find GU, out of curiosity? I&#039;m always interested to find how the internet&#039;s wayward travelers come by.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, I see. I must have misread. But to know you see these, I feel the need to mention that reading your comic from beginning to the current page (all in the same day mind you.... I&#039;m hooked.. what can I say?) You&#039;ve rekindled a creative spirit in me that I thought I might have lost. And you&#039;ve revived dreams of publishing that had consumed me before bouts of my own depression tore those dreams apart and threw them away. If...no..WHEN i finally publish...there will have to be a dedication to you and your contribution to my vigor to complete and publish a novel that has lived in my heart since I was 16 as well as a possible series based on a roleplay that carried on for the better part of 3 years! I&#039;m so excited! Thank youuuu :D]]></description>
