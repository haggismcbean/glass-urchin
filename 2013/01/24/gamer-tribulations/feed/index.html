		<description><![CDATA[Hey I am an RE whore... I&#039;ll play through RE5 or 6 with anyone who will have me. ;P

Mel is great! RE6 is good - it takes some getting used to... The characters are large and take up a larger portion of the screen and at first it&#039;s hard to get used to. Also the pacing of some of the chapters is insane! But I like it and the four separate storylines that intertwine is a cool addition!
I think if you enjoyed RE5 you&#039;ll enjoy this, as long as you don&#039;t get too caught up thinking about the stupid plot :P]]></description>
