		<description><![CDATA[ah, yeah. it does make it a bit more difficult if you don&#039;t already have a bike. i don&#039;t have one myself, but i&#039;ve been thinking about getting one for a while. (not to mention the last two times i tried to ride a bike i was afraid i was going to get myself killed.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@AG - Yeah it&#039;s been suggested. It&#039;s just not as easy to buy a bike and then go to a specific spot where i&#039;d feel comfortable biking around in as it is to just put on sneakers and jog in whatever park I happen across. I ought to try it though, supposedly it&#039;s a very healthy way to exercise.]]></description>
