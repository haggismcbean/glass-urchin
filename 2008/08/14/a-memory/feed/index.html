		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Kusandha - very nicely done. And I think there are many that will relate to what you&#039;re saying. What happens to us, anyways, that we can accept people for who they are until we&#039;re a certain age and then we allow the outside world to start influencing our decisions? Let&#039;s stick with the kindergarten basic ideals of good vs. bad -  &quot;she&#039;s nice because she let me borrow her crayon&quot; and &quot;I don&#039;t like him because he took my toy.&quot;

Sometimes comics have to touch on real-life and real-life isn&#039;t always funny. The trick is to do it in such a way that it&#039;s thoughtful and people will come back for more and maybe toss in a little humor along the way. You&#039;re dead on. Ctrl+Alt+Del ran a rather serious line recently and I loved it.

I want to cuddle your little hedgehog representation now - she looks so sad!!]]></description>
