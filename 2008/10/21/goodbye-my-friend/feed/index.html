		<description><![CDATA[@Felicity
Thanks for your kind words...  It hurts a lot because Ashes was my first real pet (we had a bunny and hamsters before, but none of them were around for half as long as she was, and none of them had the lovingly insistent personality that she had)....  We have since adopted two new kittens, and I look at them knowing I will eventually love them like I did Ashes, they will go through their life sharing their happiness with us, and they will eventually go someday too.  I hope it&#039;s a long time from now, and I hope we can give them as much love as Ashes gave us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I share your pain, and was in tears hearing your rememberances.  I have lost a lot of cats over a lifetime.  Sometimes it makes me scared to love so much.  Because there are some who you seem to connect with in such a special way. They make you laugh, and bring you joy.  The time spent together is precious.  It&#039;s like you know what the other is thinking and feeling.  Guess what?  Beloved cat feels the same towards you as you do for him/her.  If you were to die first, cat would feel same saddness, but would go on living.  So must you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks everyone for your condolences.
@ Leda - the great thing about Ashes was she was like a kid at some points, playing games and vying for attention...  But also like a good friend at other points, obviously choosing to hang out with you because it made her happy, not just because she needed you.  
@ Shivi - I know quite a few people who love cats and are allergic to them...  The key thing- meds!
@Chthon - Yes, I hope she remembers the happy times and not the pain, in her last moments or wherever she is now.  
@bree - Yeah, Ashes just loved to dig under the stove, occasionally eat dust, and then continue to attack things.  She also used to put her paws under the door from the other side if we were in the room and the door was closed.  She looked as if she was trying to attack something, but I think she might have just been seeking attention :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[;_; what nice words.  I always wanted a pet that would love me when i was down.  Fish never showed much love &gt;.&gt;.  
I&#039;m pretty sure there would be more cat lovers if a lot of us weren&#039;t allergic to them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Man, I&#039;ve always loved cats too myself.  Ashes reminds me of my mom&#039;s new cat Sam who never complains and just seems to know when you need to pet something.  The world needs more cat lovers.  :)
I&#039;m sad that you lost your cat, but be happy that you were able to give her such a fulfilling life.]]></description>
