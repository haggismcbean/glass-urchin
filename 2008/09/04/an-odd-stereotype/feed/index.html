		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a Scorpio, and I&#039;ve been stereotyped because of it often. Granted, it&#039;s usually accurate. The weirdest thing to become of it was when a guy asked me my Zodiac sign, and after I told him, he says, &quot;Awesome, I love Scorpios. They make awesome lovers. *wink* Can I take you to lunch?&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yea, I noticed that (I am a virgo) and I have a lot of &quot;fire sign&quot; friends - Aries and Caps and the bf is a Sagg.  And I don&#039;t really know many of certain signs like Pisces (only my mom).  But I never hold it to anyone of course :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh dear. It&#039;s one thing to look up astrological signs and watch to see if they apply in real life, but to automatically assume that all signs have all the traits stereotypically associated with them... is foolish. &gt;_&gt; Even by astrology standards -- heck, rising signs and the like can supposedly throw all of that off.

However... I have noticed that everyone I&#039;ve become good friends with has been either an Aries, a Virgo, or a Capricorn. I noticed it in retrospect, and I try not to take it to much into account when meeting people (&quot;Oh, you&#039;re Aquarius -- well, we&#039;ll probably never be friends&quot;) since that would be silly, but I do find it interesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nobody believes I&#039;m an Aries.  In Japan nobody believed my bloodtype was B (they are infamous for their free spirit and laziness).  I think these classifications are only as accurate as we want them to be.  The only stereotype i live upto is indians being good at math.]]></description>
