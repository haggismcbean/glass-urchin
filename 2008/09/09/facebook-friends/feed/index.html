		<description><![CDATA[Hey guys... I have no problem whatsoever with catbook.  that&#039;s fine to keep your kitty obsessions to yourself. But i think it&#039;s weird when people make actual fb profiles for pets...  i mean the whole point of fb is to have updates/messaging abilities with all your friends, and pets don&#039;t really enter into it.
but using fb for pet photos and stuff like that is probably a better way to incorporate pet stuff]]></description>
