		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I know in some cases, religion is very important to a superhero such as some of the X-men - Kitty, Kurt, and Ororo for some (surprised I didn&#039;t see Nightcrawler on that chart listing, I thought he was one of the most dedicated and religious of superheroes.  I&#039;m sure he&#039;s on the page somewhere though).  But it&#039;s difficult to believe that most of them are so religious when their teammates are gods incarnate anyway.  Oh well.  I guess people STILL need &quot;structure&quot; in their lives, even so.
And I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve seen instances where people hint to being atheist, at least in UXM anyway (I&#039;m mostly a Marvel/X-men person, in terms of plain superhero books).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been on that site a few times now. People really, really like their superheroes, mind you. And sometimes they like to associate with the heroes more when they find out certain religious leanings of them. The Thing and Shadowcat have large Jewish followings from this.
Atheists, though, have trouble claiming characters, as they are rarely written by atheists. It&#039;s also an easy crutch to establish someone as evil by making them an atheist (there&#039;s about a half dozen villains on that list).
DC Atheists Mr. Terrific II and Starman I (yes, I am that geeky) have been some of the more fascinating ones, as they are widely considered to be some of the smartest people in that universe. Meanwhile, they team up with The Specter, who is believed to be the embodiment of God&#039;s Wrath. Both have noted that there&#039;s other possible explanations for Specter&#039;s power, and it&#039;s silly to rule those out.]]></description>
