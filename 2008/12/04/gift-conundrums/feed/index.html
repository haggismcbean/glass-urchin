		<description><![CDATA[Aww...  I ought to be more clear on my bg stuff.  I hate that I have to use photos sometime (5th panel)...  

Thanks on the compliment, it&#039;s very much appreciated!  Yeah, I&#039;m trying to walk the line between cute and obnoxious...  It&#039;s a thin line but I hope I&#039;m doing okay.]]></description>

In other news, I have to compliment your drawing. Again. Cause Mike is cute. And you are cute. And it&#039;s the kind of cute that doesn&#039;t make you want to kill kittens. Not that I would anyway, but hey.]]></description>
