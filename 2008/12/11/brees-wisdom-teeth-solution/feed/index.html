		<description><![CDATA[I had mine out a year ago even though there was nothing wrong with them just because I didn&#039;t want to have to do it after my insurance ran out. It sucked, but not nearly as bad as I was told by a lot of people. The worst part was cleaning out the holes with the little syringe they give you, but even that was more just gross than painful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah - I had two impacted out - actually, while you were working with us! It wasn&#039;t too bad. Relaxed in bed for a day and I was ok after that - just had problems eating. Ice water... numbs the pain. If that fails, go with Bree&#039;s plan. ^.^]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had all four taken out a few years back (3 impacted, 1 normal).  Just used novocaine since it was cheaper... well, anyway, it wasn&#039;t -that- bad, although it wasn&#039;t pleasant.  Hopefully things will go smoothly for you and discomfort would be at a minimum! Good luck :)]]></description>
