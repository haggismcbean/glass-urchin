		<description><![CDATA[haha your comic is adorable.  ami-hedgie expresses baby dislike well.  

I kind of like babies and I like holding them for about 5 minutes, then I realize that they&#039;re heavy and they fart and it&#039;s drooling on my arm.  there needs to be some universal sign for &quot;omg take drooling pre-human back now&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That baby is ugly!

And therefore does look like most of the younger ones out there (preamies? (sp) ).  There are exceptions when they get a little older, but still...

I agree with the staring thing.  Usually at the supermarket while waiting in line, they will -stare- and at first you make faces or whatever.  But as the cashier takes forever, it gets more and more uncomfortable as time goes by and there&#039;s only so long you could &#039;fiddle&#039; with the gum and magazines next to you... only to look back up and there he/she is, still STARING.
