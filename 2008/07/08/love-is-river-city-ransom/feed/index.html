		<description><![CDATA[Oh man, I STILL haven&#039;t beaten Zelda II! I got angry at it when I was like 4 or 5 and just never went back to it. Then I brought all my original NES games out of storage (Yes I bought a functionion 8-bit system in 2008) a lil while back and realized my annoyance was prolly just due to my inability to read at the time... God willing I will have it beatin in a few weeks (Or in a few hours if I lose all self control and don&#039;t sleep). Thanks for the reminder! Dig the comic of course, by the by.]]></description>
