							<p>I don&#8217;t remember when I started to &#8220;draw.&#8221;  I think, when we were children, we all drew.  If you asked a classmate in second grade to draw you a sheep, they wouldn&#8217;t say &#8220;I can&#8217;t draw,&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m not good at it.&#8221;  They would just draw.  Everything was blank, like a clean sheet of paper.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder when that began to change.  Probably it was in fifth grade that I finally got some compliments on my drawing from my peers, who maybe half of had given up on drawing.  Back then of course, I drew mostly copies&#8230; Especially copies of Lion King characters, from the movie which had come out that same year.  Later on I drew copies of other characters from cartoons and comics until I finally began to develop something akin to my own style.  Just to let you know, I still don&#8217;t have it down right.  </p>
<p>Here we are at the beginning of Glass Urchin.  Although it&#8217;s kind of a debut webcomic, I feel like there&#8217;s a lot more behind it than it looks.  Up until now, I&#8217;ve been hacking away at different styles, stories, and comics, and none of them have worked their way to full fruition.  So right now I&#8217;m approaching a huge step in my artistic life&#8230;  It&#8217;s not my masterpiece yet, but hey&#8230;  I&#8217;m working on it.  </p>
<p>The Glass Urchin will be updated bi-weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  It is a proud part of <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com">Nerdcomics</a>, which is led by one of my best friends, bree.  Please do check out her introductory comic to The Glass Urchin <a href="http://www.sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/2008/07/04/100-sexes-drugs-and-june-cleavers/">here</a>.  </p>

							<p>So it&#8217;s been about a month of me writing comics and posting them&#8230; I guess I ought to start blogging.  I was never really good at this- just blogging randomly about life stuff, but I will give it my best shot!  </p>
<p>And onto the topic of today&#8217;s posts: homemade articles of cuteness!  Okay, I&#8217;m not sure exactly how long this site has been around (and I&#8217;m sure there are many more like it out there), but I just bought myself a very cheap and cute wallet from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=29119">tinymeat&#8217;s</a> shop on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>.  Etsy is a wonderful shopping site where you can peruse through all assortments of handmade goods from jewelry to clothes to cutesy and artistic items.  There&#8217;s a lot of neat stuff here for those into the craft and local scene.  Etsy sellers run the gamut from high-end glass blowers to people with interests in knitting or crocheting.  And if you need a place to start, check out these really cute wallets from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=29119">tinymeat&#8217;s</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=13795197"><img src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/extra/tinymeat_pegacorn.jpg" alt="it reminds me of bree..."></a>  <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=13793039"><img src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/extra/tinymeat_dino.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Does anyone else have any favorite online homemade craft shops to share?  </p>

							<p>This Sunday, the 17th of August 2008, my good friends Dylan (<a href="http://www.dubiousadventures.com/">Dubious Adventures</a>) and Heather (<a href="http://www.tacoyaki.com/">Tacoyaki</a>) got married in Honolulu, Hawaii!  I wish you both a wonderful and happy marriage!  You&#8217;ve been through a lot together, from long-distance relationshipping (I met Dylan in Japan during a year of study abroad we did together), to surviving in the loneliness of the Japanese inaka (after they graduated, Dylan and Heather did JET for two years near the Kobe area).  Now I wish you both great health and happiness (and food) in your new life in Hawaii.  Much love to you both, always.</p>

<p>Edit: This blog entry gets a lot of spam a day, and I think it&#8217;s because i was talking about the you-know-what (f-o-r-u-m).  I edited the title in hopes that people will stop effin&#8217; spamming this topic &gt;.&gt;</p>
<p>Edit again: Okay this stupid topic gets spam all the time, will close comments on this one.</p>

							<p>So, I&#8217;ve decided to slightly delay the Thursday update.  Since the beginning, I have been updating in the early am of Tuesday and then the early am of Thursday.  However, I realize that only gives the Tuesday comic two business days of being up (cause really, we know everyone looks at comics most at work!), the Thursday comic being up for the rest and the weekend.  So from now on I think I&#8217;ll try to upload the Thursday comic sometime in the evening hours, so as to let the Tuesday comic have about half of the spotlight.</p>
<p>And as for our sponsors, The Glass Urchin doesn&#8217;t really have any!  But I have been looking into linking to webcomic lists and databases, please do suggest one if I haven&#8217;t already joined it.  You can now find me on <a href="http://www.frumph.net/">Frumph Net</a> and <a href="http://www.drunkduck.com/The_Glass_Urchin/">Drunk Duck</a> (although I don&#8217;t really understand how that site works).  If you have time, please click on through to Frumph (and any links I post hereafter) to give me a boost in stats.  Much obliged!</p>
<p>*<span style="color: red;">Edit</span>*  Please also click on <a href="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com">The Webcomic List</a> or use the links at the bottom of the page to boost my rankings, if you&#8217;ve got a spare moment in your day!!  The more you do, the more likely it is I&#8217;ll appear on an ad with that site.  Thanks guys!</span></p>

						<small>Monday, September 15th, 2008</small>
						<div class="entry">
							<p>After much deliberating, I decided to throw in an <strong>extra update</strong> this week, on a topic I feel very strongly about.  You can expect it on <strong>Wednesday</strong>, so I hope you will join me on that day and check out my comic.  Within the upcoming weeks, expect some more extra comics, which will all follow a similar vein.  It&#8217;s a &#8220;side story&#8221; of sorts &#8211; it&#8217;ll hopefully garner some attention from the people who need to pay attention&#8230;  I hope.  </p>
<p>Also between this week and next, expect some style changes as well.  I&#8217;ve been working hard on improving my art, but I&#8217;ve suddenly become quite busy, taking on a new temp job and a new request for a comic anthology just last week and that, coupled with The Glass Urchin regular updates, an upcoming &#8220;extras&#8221; page, and my &#8220;side story,&#8221; have swamped me.  I think I&#8217;ll be able to keep up with all these projects, wish me luck!</p>

						<small>Tuesday, September 30th, 2008</small>
						<div class="entry">
							<p>I thought I&#8217;d take some time out of my busy schedule to dally, and talk about my inspiration.  I&#8217;ve been trying to improve my art and all, and you might be interested in learning what&#8217;s made me do what I do and what makes me keep wanting to be better.</p>
<p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v305/auilix/031_fone_bone.jpg" align="right">One of the first true inspirations, one where I&#8217;ve really first taken a step back from the comic to admire the art, was Jeff Smith&#8217;s <a href="http://www.boneville.com/">Bone</a>.  I first started reading probably in fifth grade, when Disney Adventures did a Bone run in one of its issues.  I had a childlike admiration for the first valley scene, in which Fone Bone stumbles upon the valley for the first time, and the trees and mountains fill the page deeply and beautifully.  Later, when I really got into the series, I admired it for Smith&#8217;s great storytelling &#8211; He is able to weave comedy, suspense, drama, and a lot of character into these apparently simple beings.  Even later still, I began to admire Jeff Smith&#8217;s clean and concise (yet somewhat cartoony) linework and especially his inking.  If there was ever someone who inspired me to take up ink and pen, it was Jeff Smith.  Check out his work if you haven&#8217;t already &#8211; you won&#8217;t be dissappointed!</p>
<p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v305/auilix/tintin.gif" align="left">Going further back into my early childhood, <a href="http://www.tintin.com/index.html#home/une.swf&#038;lang=uk/">Tintin</a> was a heavy influence that really drew me to the world of comics.  Of course, Uncanny X-Men, Sonic the Hedgehog, Disney comics and more followed up, but at first, it was always Tintin.  It&#8217;s probably because my dad&#8217;s side of the family was born and raised in Paris (where everyone has the entire set &#8211; I&#8217;ve been in many French houses, and even the poorest does not go without their Tintin comics), where Tintin is very popular.  I loved to read through the well thought out adventures, and the detail of some of Herge&#8217;s spreads was just amazing.  I find that I enjoy doing <a href="/glass-urchin/2008/07/01/the-beginning/">large crowd scenes</a> and, even though I&#8217;m not too good at it, people seem to enjoy them a lot too.  And I&#8217;m also a great fan of Herge&#8217;s art movement, the <a href="http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/071_clearline/071_clearline.htm">clear line</a> look (which I think Bone might be a part of as well).  </p>
<p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v305/auilix/blankets299.jpg" align="right">During my college years, I became enamored with a beautiful love story by <a href="http://blog.dootdootgarden.com/">Craig Thompson</a>, called Blankets.  This lovely black and white (because, like Bone, the author and artist inked all in black and white, and the result had wonderful and wonderfully different affects) tale was bittersweet and real, and made me turn my attention to the somewhat new genre of autobiographical comic stories.  I began to turn my back on my fictional characters (though I still enjoy drawing them) and started to look for a style that would suit me in my own autobiographical comic.  I&#8217;m still looking for it, in case you were wondering.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="http://www.scottmccloud.com/">Scott McCloud&#8217;s</a> help books about writing and drawing comics was a huge help.  Above and beyond any regular &#8220;help&#8221; books you might find, McCloud&#8217;s book is entertaining and complex, in addition to being helpful.  He really helped me get my act together and inspired me to put pen and pencil to paper for a purpose, and not just let my ideas die in oblivion.  </p>
<p>I hope you have the time to check out these guys and their great works!  Maybe next time I&#8217;ll talk about some smaller titles that have also inspired me in some way or another.</p>

						<small>Monday, October 13th, 2008</small>
						<div class="entry">
							<p>Hi all &#8211; Just to keep you all posted on life and my current situation, I just want to let everyone know that it&#8217;s been very busy lately.  Along with keeping up with both <a href="http://www.superbarracuda.com">Super Barracuda!</a> and The Glass Urchin, I&#8217;ve been really busy as well.  You&#8217;ve now seen that I&#8217;ve been accepted at a very neat company and I now have a <a hrf="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/2008/10/07/job-1/">job</a>, since about mid-September.  I&#8217;ve been trying to squeeze in all the comics I need to do along with work and everything else, but bear with me if anything does lag behind (I hope it won&#8217;t get to that though).  I also have some small health concerns that have been afflicting me&#8230;  But now that I have a job, health care will soon follow, thank goodness.</p>
<p>In addition to everything, my little kitty of 12 years (I could&#8217;ve sworn we&#8217;ve been together for longer!), Ashes, has been having a lot of health problems.  She lives at my parent&#8217;s home and I&#8217;ve not been able to spend as much time at home now that I have work.  I wish I could help my mom take care of her, it&#8217;s a huge burden and she&#8217;s been doing everything mostly on her own.  I&#8217;m afraid that it might be the end and every time I get a chance to do home, despite everyone&#8217;s best attempts, she&#8217;s been getting frailer and frailer.  It&#8217;s depressing to see her so small and feeble, and I only see her briefly so I can&#8217;t imagine what mom must be going through.  </p>
<p>So just bear with me, everyone.  I promise I&#8217;ll do everything to keep updating The Glass Urchin, but I might not have such a big presence online for a while.  </p>

<center>Rest in Peace, little Ashes.  <br />Mar 1996 &#8211; Oct. 18 2008<br /> </center></p>
<p><img src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/extra/ashes/ashes_windowtiny.jpg" align="right">This weekend, my little Ashes passed away.  She was our little grey blob of a housecat, she came into our home when I was in 5th grade.  She brought happiness and unreserved love into a household that sorely needed it.  When, at times, it seemed like there was no one for you, there was Ashes, for each one of us.  It&#8217;s difficult for me to talk about Ashes like this&#8230;  My mind wanders from the happy times and the bad, from the many funny, annoying, happy, lazy, exciting times we had together.  In the end of the summer, she began to limp.  After taking her to the vet, she fell ill.  By the time the leaves changed colors, she was gone.  </p>
<p>I never understood why people hated cats.  I could never understand the aloof, timid, or scary cat that people spoke about.  Of course, Ashes has many times when she would do her own thing.  But being with her, you understood her life revolved around the world of our family.  Sometimes, I think, it was her main goal in life to lay as closely as possible to you because it would make her so incredibly content.  I cried sometimes, to think that there was a little being that loved me so honestly and whole-heartedly, that just sitting next to her made her so happy.  </p>
<p>She was so trusting of us&#8230;  Sometimes to her own downfall.  When we were both younger, she once climbed a tall pine tree all the way to the top.  I came outside to look for her, and when I called out her name, she replied by meowing pitifully from the branches of the tree.  I went underneath and looked up and, unthinkingly, held my arms out and called out her name again.  Poor kitty!  Looking down, I guess she saw that I was offering to catch her, so she finally let go.  To me from the ground, she looked like a rocketing flurry of claws and fur!  I stepped aside, afraid for my own skin, and she fell splat (on all fours, as they do)!!  I felt really bad for panicking like that, but I had not expected her to actually let go, since most cats don&#8217;t trust anyone to take them out of trees.  But she did, and I&#8217;ve always felt guilty for not catching her when she fell.  Thankfully though, she was somehow fine from the incident (thank goodness for the toughness of younger cats)!</p>
<p><img src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/extra/ashes/ashes_supercute.jpg" align="left">I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;ve made this so sad and mushy.  Truth is, I think we all were surprised at how much she affected our lives.  To have a little diligent kitty who always waited at the door when you came home to greet you (and beg for food too!), and then to come home to an empty house hurts.  To think that she&#8217;ll never meow her pleas to sleep in your bed, never curl up in her favorite spot under the tree this Christmas, never look out the window to watch the birds again hurts.  To see the very shadows of our home, and to think she wouldn&#8217;t be in them ever again hurts.  It pained me to see her life and her joys slowly move out as she got more and more sick&#8230;  I am admittedly relieved that she doesn&#8217;t need to suffer any more.  But I hope deeply that even in the end she remembered the happy times she had with us and the joy she brought to us.  I hope you&#8217;ve found whatever it was that was under the stove you wanted, I hope you catch that laser beam dot you could never get your nimble paws on, and I hope there are no vacuum cleaners where you are.  You will not be forgotten by any of us, our little Ashes.  </p>
