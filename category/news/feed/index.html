				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So in order to improve my storytelling abilities, I started taking one of those Skillshare classes (the only time I&#8217;ve ever actually clicked on (and purchased!) from a FB ad) &#8211; <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/The-Art-of-Visual-Storytelling/2008820318/1833412080/">The Art of Visual Storytelling</a>. It was only $10, so I figured I could do with some lessons from a Disney Animator on how to effectively tell a story in a single image. For our first project I did a couple of images, and the instructor said he liked mine a close second (in a class of over 700 students)! Yay. His critique was encouraging. Anyhow, to show you that I&#8217;m not (yet) dead, here&#8217;s what I submitted:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/skillshare/uploads/project/fffe9d9b01547bf13577316d03dd7d1e/dff9daad" width="460"></p>
<p>And you can see more on my project&#8217;s submission page <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/The-Art-of-Visual-Storytelling/2008820318/1833412080/projects/6777">here</a>, because I also did another image and some thumbnails.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" style="margin: 5px;" alt="dude, shoot her." src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v305/auilix/clip-shoother-1.png" width="130" height="437" />As a sort of break from the madcap daily schedule of tutorials tutorials rendering rendering modelling modelling tutorials tutorials that entails working on my portfolio, I decided to do one of <a href="http://storyshots.tumblr.com/">Emma Coats</a>&#8216; drawing exercises &#8220;<a href="http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/42768317672/drawing-from-films-drawing-from-films-is-a">Drawing from Film</a>,&#8221; in which you take a film that you like and draw every single cut. She recommended Spielberg or any movie you know by heart, and the only Spielbergs I know near by heart are Jurassic Park and Last Crusade, so I chose JP since I haven&#8217;t seen it in a while. I know she recommends not doing too much detail, and I haven&#8217;t really, but I wanted to at least also try to get the mood of the actors or the scene as well. I&#8217;m also trying to kick my bad drawing habits, and hopefully over the film&#8217;s however-many-hundreds of cuts I&#8217;ll be able to: my need to erase everything a hundred times, my attention to details that don&#8217;t matter, my poor ability to draw hats. Jurassic Park has a lot of hats.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never studied film and I am horrible at noticing things like direction in films, nor do I want to go into such a field. However I think all art can tell a story and the storytelling aspects of each shot or composition is really helpful to see from such a master&#8217;s perspective. For example, take a look at the very first scene in Jurassic Park. Spielberg allows for several closeups of unimportant background characters (whom he largely ignores in the following four or five scenes) to underline the nervous apprehension of the people in the opening crowd, and to better juxtapose humanity versus nature. The raptor cage comes seemingly right out of the forest and he keeps the left side (humans, the cage, bright lights, technology) and the right side (raptor, wilderness, forest, violence) very well separated in the ensuing shots, even when the cage comes into the human territory and the characters should be all turned around &#8211; the humans still face towards the right and the raptor to the left.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe he didn&#8217;t mean all that, but it&#8217;s still fun to think about! Anyway, you can check out my sketches of the first 20 minutes of Jurassic Park here. A great activity while you&#8217;re waiting for scenes to render!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It only took about three years and dozens of comments to spurn me to finally update it, but here it is, the new <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/about/">About page</a> with a sparkly new cast!  There are still some folks missing from it but you know what I already spent way too much precious time updating it when I could be doing more important things like, I dunno, creating more awesome art!?</p>
<p>Anyway now you can click on each character and see all the comics they&#8217;re in.  You can actually do this with each new page that has a character, since the pages are all tagged, but I figured I would make it easier for you to stalk your favourite character.  Who knows, maybe one day I&#8217;ll actually make new wallpapers.</p>

Been working really hard on design and modelling and animation stuff, will hopefully have something good to share at the end of the semester. But a heads up that comics may lag behind, hopefully not soon but it might be inevitable!</p>
<p>Oh and on a break from work I took one of those gif memes that have been floating around and this one I hope will be really accurate:<br />
&#8220;The tenth is how you will spend your last day on earth&#8221;<br />

She (I?) makes her stitched debut <a href="http://www.plusonecomic.com/2011/07/ami-the-hedgehog/">here</a>, as the titular character&#8217;s new toy!  Plus One is an endearing webcomic about an interesting and new life journey.  And hey, just like it was recently Anna&#8217;s birthday, it was also the birthday of The Glass Urchin a couple of days ago, so this comes as a nice GU birthday treat!  Thanks Dustin!</p>

We were switching to a faster server and the process took far longer than expected.  I&#8217;m back, but we&#8217;re still working on fixing the .coms now.  Will keep you posted.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, don&#8217;t forget to check out the <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/2011/01/18/music-food/">Tuesday comic</a> from this week, the Thursday one will be posted shortly.  Also you can check out the neat results of our lated and most crowded comic meetup <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/?p=1189">January Jam session</a>!  Thanks for sticking around guys!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bree and I had an awesome weekend at <a href="http://www.brooklynlyceum.com/">Brooklyn Lyceum&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.kingconbrooklyn.com/">KingCon</a>, thanks to all who stopped by!  I think Bree summed up the craziness that was this past weekend with this (very real) comic about how it made us accidentally run in the <a href="http://www.sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/2010/11/08/11082010/">NY Marathon</a>.  Anyway it was great meeting all of you, and sorry if I seemed out of it &#8211; it&#8217;s just the usual con wear and tear.  Rifling through the stuff I picked up, I met <a href="http://www.megan-brennan.com">Megan Brennan</a>, who I traded for a cute mini &#8220;Melvin Lampius Saves the Day!&#8221; (I love the art and colouring style!), <a href="http://www.mmm-hmm.com">Kevin Shelley</a>, who had a beautifully presented book called Mmm-Hmm, <a href="http://firstlawofmadscience.com/">Mike Isenberg</a>, who I had met at NYCC but then met again at KingCon and who gave me a sample of his book, <a href="http://glitchworks.com/">Tim Piotrowski</a> who had beautiful new editions of his great book about the Kool Aid Man, <a href="http://www.thelindo.com/">Sara and Steve</a>, who I should have realized earlier were from my neck of the woods (sorry!), and <a href="http://www.jamietanner.com/">Jamie Tanner</a>, whose work is just beautiful (I need to buy me some prints next time).  Phew!  We also hung out with some of our good friends who do <a href="http://tapirtooth.blogspot.com/">Tapir Tooth</a>: <a href="http://andreatsurumi.com/">Andrea</a>, <a href="http://www.miriamgibson.com/">Miriam</a>, <a href="http://www.peterquach.com/">Peter</a>, and Blu-jay, as well as our usual crowd of comic and art friends.  Gah!  Sorry if I forgot anyone!</p>
<p>We were also interviewed by <a href="http://jimmyaquino.typepad.com/">Jimmy Aquino</a> at <a href="http://www.comicnewsinsider.com">Comic News Insider</a>, and the full interview, plus interviews with other talented artists at the con can be heard <a href="http://www.jimmyaquino.typepad.com/comicnewsinsider/2010/11/episode-303-king-con-with-abede-lovelace-bree-rubin-ami-bogan-fred-chao-jamie-tanner-jonathan-baylis.html">here</a>!!!  He interviewed Bree and I as well as some other talented folks who tabled at <a href="http://www.kingconbrooklyn.com/">KingCon</a>.  He also picked up a copy of my first book and gave it a really nice review nearing the end of the podcast.  Please give it a listen!</p>
