		<description><![CDATA[XD Well at least you haven&#039;t ended up like a guy I knew in passing online: He once had a sort of action-adventure dream, woke up, thought his clock was a gun&#039;s laser sight, and rolled onto the floor to avoid it, hurting his shoulder. One of the more interesting ways to hurt yourself, to be sure. (cackles)

Anyway, you&#039;re welcome, Auilix. ^n_n^

(PS: Hey Rahnee, did you get your name from &quot;ElfQuest&quot;?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Rahnee
yeah, the character is mostly based on an african pygmy hedgehog, but I based the longer ears on the (appropriately named) long-eared hedgehog: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog#Genera_and_species

hahaha too much harvest moon huh?  :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know that&#039;s a hedgehog in panel three, but she looks kinda like a bunny to me. As far as alarm clocks go, I went through a phrase where I dreamed mine was a controller and that I was playing Harvest Moon. lol]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, sometimes I&#039;m still sleepy and dreamy when I look at the clock and I&#039;m like &quot;oh noes, how do i disarm this bomb!?&quot; and it seriously must take me a while to &quot;figure it out&quot;  XD

Thanks for your compliments, Multi-F!  I&#039;m glad people are enjoying the ride :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh man, my alarm gets mixed in my dreams too. My dream-self goes berserk trying to find the source, and then I realize &quot;Oh, that&#039;s my alarm. Gotta hit the snooze.&quot; So I hit the snooze and drift off again, and when the alarm goes off another time, I don&#039;t panic.

=====

So far I&#039;m enjoying your comic very much; it&#039;s a nice little slice-of-life that&#039;s made all the cuter for the main characters being represented by animals. It&#039;s hard to say exactly why it&#039;s so charming, but I&#039;m going to keep reading. ^n_n^v Thank you for sharing it.]]></description>
