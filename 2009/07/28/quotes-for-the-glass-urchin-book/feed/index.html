		<description><![CDATA[Hi! I found your comic just last week (you can thank ad banners for that), and I really think it&#039;s something special. Not only is it funny, but it&#039;s as adorable as all get-out. The cuteness is strong with this one.

I was actually coming here to comment on the comic itself, but then I scrolled down and noticed this. So, I figure, why not?

&quot;The most adorable hedgehog in the world loves, laughs, and shakes her spiny little rump in this simultaneously realistic and fantastic first-person view of a unique artist&#039;s life.&quot; - VC

Anyway, something tells me I&#039;ll be reading this comic for a while.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A splendidly surreal journey through the life of an artist, One will find themselves laughing at the wonderfully bright humour then reflecting on the truisms found in each elegant brushstroke. - Darky

DJ, I wanted to say &#039;wonderfully poignant&#039; too. Oh well! Here be my honest contribution. Even if these don&#039;t make it onto a dust cover, at least they&#039;ll let Ami know how much we enjoy her comic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Wonderfully poignant.&quot; -DJ Trousdale

Really anything involving the word &quot;poignant&quot; will work; that&#039;s in virtually all artsy quotes.
At one time I was confused because I thought it the word &quot;pregnant&quot; with an accent. XD]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glass Urchin&#039;s filled with love, brilliance, and humor, in a way that reminds us what brings out the best in life; and yet it it doesn&#039;t stop there. When Ami Bogin touches pen to paper, the ordinary becomes magic.

- Brian St. Claire

(I think that sounds a hell of a lot better than &quot;spiked tour de force&quot;)]]></description>
