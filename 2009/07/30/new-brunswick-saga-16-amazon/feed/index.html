		<description><![CDATA[I think the only reason girls think guys are dumb is because they rarely seem to make any first moves, and a lot seem to even give up at the start.  We&#039;re girls, not fire-breathing dragons!  Lose the loser mentality and I think we have more respect for guys.  Maybe this is why a lot of girls end up with jerks - a lot of guys who make hard moves (like whistling at girls etc) are jerks.  We just want some nice balance in between - pay attention to us and flirt (but not too much) and you never know what&#039;ll happen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You go girl!  :D
Agreed with Tina on boys being dumb.  I especially get annoyed with those mopey types who are like &quot;well she doesnt want to hang out with me anyway *mope mope*&quot;.  If girls were that way too, we&#039;d never get anywhere.

Whenever I talk about this with mom, she always tells me she had to bat boys off with sticks because they came on so hard (but that was then, this is now).]]></description>
