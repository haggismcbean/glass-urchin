		<description><![CDATA[Hello auilix! I wish you all the best for the upcoming promotional WAR! at frumph.net! May the best one win! Without much doubt I will not be the lucky one: We Germans are only got at playing soccer… Well, at last my photographed superheroes will start their training lessons in the next Episode of Union of Heroes (www.unionofheroes.com)… Is it a coincidence that you start the &quot;WAR!&quot; with this story about your fathers army pranks? Or did you plan this? … Best regards from Dortmund, Germany! thirtyseven]]></description>
