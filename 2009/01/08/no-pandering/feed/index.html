		<description><![CDATA[Ha ha ha, for clarification I did not ask to be IN the comic. I was just wondering what animal I would be hypothetically. Granted I&#039;m of course a narcasist and therefore am happy to have people talking about me. It&#039;s merely a principal I uphold (kiwi and Tim&#039;s roommate Nick demands regularly to be in the comic. This is the only reason he has never appeared).

However thank you kindly! Hee hee!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh, a scenario I am all too familiar with! XD It&#039;s even worse when you have people acting wild or talking about strange things around you in the hopes that they&#039;ll be the weird thing of the day and get a comic made about them.

Totally not the point of a journal comic, you guys!! ^^;]]></description>
