		<description><![CDATA[Well I&#039;m not sure if Faye is the authority on uhh marriage (no offense Faye!!).  I do think that in those kind of relationships, sometimes you know your partner better than your know yourself but on the other hand it would get annoying if you just assumed you knew every time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dude, that makes it sound more like your his mommy than his gf, and despite what freud says: That just ain&#039;t right... his think this is one of the reasona why I stay away from these &quot;relationship&quot; things. Picking a defacto brand of cigarettes is about all the comitment I can handle, heh heh.

		<description><![CDATA[Funny and true. Although,  there were numerous times I did things whether or not my significant other said he wanted it because I knew he would later, so it was easier to take care of it then and there.

Or the guy could just be a retard.]]></description>
