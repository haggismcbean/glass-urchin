		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha, oh man, if you actually said that, you have surpassed me in verbal dumbassery! And that&#039;s quite a feat I&#039;ll have you know. 

By the way, I&#039;m heading out of town on a retreat starting today, if you still need the XP etc I can maybe leave a disk here and you can come by and pick it up. I don&#039;t have a disk that will hold CS4 unfortunately, but if you are not in a rush for that I&#039;ll be back weekend after this.]]></description>
