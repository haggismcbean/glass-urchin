		<description><![CDATA[PS3 is not so expensive if you factor in that it comes with wireless (which is extra 100 on X360) and has free online, but yeah, even I&#039;m always thinking of getting the 360 for Braid etc.

Foley - Movie store is there on PS3 as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a tough one, I think I like the ps3 games better (little big planet, disgaea, etc), but the X-box has the DLC for fallout as well as fun goodies like streaming netflix and an itunes style movie store... Then again the PS3 lets you buy old ps1 games (like wild arms!) and has a free weird &quot;other life&quot; esque

In the end I&#039;d go for the PS3... But that may be because me and Bree both have 
one: so we can be friends on PSN!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah I&#039;m still not sure.  
On Xbox i want to play Left 4 Dead and Resident Evil 5, along with those arcade titles like Braid, Castle Crashers and Geometry Wars.
On PS3 I want to play MGS 3, Valkyria Chronicles, and Resident Evil 5 (and probably LBP too).

BAH!  Decisions decisions...  The subscription thingie annoys me its true, but the PS3 is so expensive... &gt;.&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ideally, you get both =D. I will always push for a PS3 so I have people I can play with that way, but in the end, both systems are about the same. Did you factor in the accessories you might need to get and Xbox Live subscription etc?]]></description>
