		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been the &quot;older guy&quot; and the &quot;younger guy&quot; - dated a 19-year old (when I was 23), a 29 year old (when I was 22), and everything in between.

But yeah, you gotta draw the line somewhere. I only dated the 19-year old because she was a) gorgeous, b) smart, and c) geeky as all get-out... then I stopped because she was also d) 19, and acted like it.

29 year old? Same reasons, except she acted like she was 14.

Have learned lesson. Will date girls that act their age, not their shoe size.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ray - yeah i know, it sucks!  i&#039;m mainly annoyed because it seems like everyone, girls included, are expect that it&#039;s norm for girls to fall for older/really older guys.  the multitude of movies about girls with older/really older guys are many and the amount of movies where the reverse happen are rare and also taboo ish.  

anyways, i&#039;m not talking demi moore/ashton kutcher acceptance here, just a couple years of leeway for gals would be awesome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let me reiterate that Mr. Efron and I are only 3 years apart whereas mrs. robinson was old enough to be his mom!!  Although, to be fair, i&#039;ll probably be oogling young, hot guys until i&#039;m a granny.  But in my case i probably wouldn&#039;t do anything about it...

that was a good movie!  must rewatch it!  :D]]></description>
