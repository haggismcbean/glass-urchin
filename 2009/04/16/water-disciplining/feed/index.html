		<description><![CDATA[You could try one of those cheap mini squirt guns.  They have a small stream that&#039;s easy to aim and they don&#039;t have too much water in them.  I&#039;ve never squirted pets with one (I just have rodents and a dog), but I&#039;ve used it to keep squirrels off the bird feeder before.  You could also put a hole through the cap of a disposeable water bottle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[you silly amy - why not pour water in a cup/glass, dip your fingers in, and flick water on the cat with your fingers. a straw would also work, if u don&#039;t have a spray bottle. anyway, isn&#039;t it too late to discipline her now? funny comic though! hehehe!]]></description>
