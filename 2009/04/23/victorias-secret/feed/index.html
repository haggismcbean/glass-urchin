		<description><![CDATA[Ugh I so agree!  It feels almost like society is telling you &quot;you&#039;re not worth it&quot; or something when they don&#039;t carry your size.  I know it has more to do with their number crunchers than me but for some reason it still feels personal.  I got so insulted when I found that the Vera Wang undies line at Kohls (extremely cute unlike the clothes which are hideous) only had A-C cups (I&#039;m a D).  It&#039;s like &quot;isn&#039;t my money good enough for you?!?&quot;.  Ridiculous, I know, but it still makes me upset.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, I love boobs and bras as much as the next guy.  They just don&#039;t have any uhh insightful info to add here besides that they like em though, haha...

at least the VS people acknowledge your presence!  it&#039;s one of the reasons why i hate women.... they look you up and down and decide &quot;not worth it!&quot; in the time span of 3 seconds.

but i love their boobs.  its probably because i dont have any myself!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem I have with VS is whenever I go in there at least 2 workers come up to me and ask: &quot;Can I help find you another size?&quot; (not just, &quot;Can I help you with something?&quot;) when I never hear them asking anyone else this and they never ask the friend I&#039;m with. In the back of my mind this is because I&#039;m on the heavier side...just leave me alone bitches! Also, all my Asian, small-boobied friends can&#039;t fit into VS bras either.

Oh and I think boys should officially be exempt from this thread...(@ brian and dylan)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[it&#039;s frustrating for me too! They never have a band size to fit me. The most frustrating part is that my twin can go in there and look amazing, and i&#039;m the flatter one : (]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It IS emotional. I&#039;ve just stopped even looking at the store, and I go along with pretending like it doesn&#039;t exist when I&#039;m in the mall. Finding bras is so hard.... :( 
I love the third panel!!! :D]]></description>
