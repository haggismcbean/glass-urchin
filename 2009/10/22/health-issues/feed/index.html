		<description><![CDATA[hypO is too little, hypER is too much, you should check that out with a doc, worst case can be diabetes mellitus(1/2); your blood sugar lvls should be between 50-130 avg, otherwise you either get sweaty, headachy and naseous(too much sugar), or pale, lower blood pressure, and later unconscious.


back in the days when I worked as paramedic, we had a woman that went to the pastry shop on a daily basis. She injected insulin before leaving the house to combat the soon-to-come sugar in the cakes and stuff. Usually she had a chat with the regulars in the store which meant she forgot to consume anything to get the insulin to work so she fainted and we were called... Groundhog day but with Emergency physicians... &gt;.&lt;]]></description>
