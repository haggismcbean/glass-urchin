		<description><![CDATA[@Auilix, having thought about your comment &quot;never sure how to draw them&quot;, I think the Uncanny Valley rules apply to drawings of humans as much they do for robots and mannequins. The closer one draws a human to look like a human, the freakier it is when the human isn&#039;t drawn *exactly like* the real thing. I suggest that unless you like putting lots of painstaking work into your drawings of humans, that you keep away from the dip of the Uncanny Valley.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually I didn&#039;t really think of it as a style... I think my human characters are always changing look because I&#039;m never sure how best to draw them. Also I knew I couldn&#039;t get to a scanner in time for this one so drew it all on the compie.

Thanks! :D]]></description>
