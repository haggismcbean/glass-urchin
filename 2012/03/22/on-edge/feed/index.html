		<description><![CDATA[Honi, you&#039;re a hell of a strong lady and have probably channeled those feelings into this comic and moved on to the slashing of the red tape and conquering of obstacles stage already, but just know that you have all of us standing right behind you for support. Just because you can&#039;t see everyone doesn&#039;t mean we&#039;re not there. ^_^;;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep... That&#039;s me, like, two days ago. Know what really helps (besides ranting and crying and sleeping and delicious food every other day and getting the giggles out of some chat with friends)? 
Time goes on. You&#039;ll get out of it eventually. We both will. Maybe we both can do better than we do (I sure can do better than that BS I&#039;ve produced of late), maybe we&#039;ll end up victorious and celebrate the hell out of what we achieved, maybe we&#039;ll just get flushed out of it and need to dry our pants before going on. But this crappy, pushy period doesn&#039;t last forever. And all along the way, there are friends to see you/us through. 
I like both thoughts. A lot. :) 
You&#039;ll be okay. We&#039;ll be okay. 
Care for a nice milk shake break before going on? *hugs*]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Auilix, you&#039;re not standing on the edge of a cliff. You&#039;re standing on a ledge. To your left was the entrance to that ledge. Can&#039;t go back that way. to the right is the exit. It&#039;s far, but you can make it. And believe it or not, if you look hard enough, you can see other people, on that same ledge.]]></description>
