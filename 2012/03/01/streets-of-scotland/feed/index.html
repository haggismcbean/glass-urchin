		<description><![CDATA[Today I had a chat with a co-worker. She asked me how I was. I was too puzzled to answer the question. Her reply to me blowing my cheeks instead was remarkable: &quot;Don&#039;t tell me. I don&#039;t think I can handle that.&quot; 
Take care of yourself. Pretty please. Honestly. If you learn how to take care of yourself (so your metabolism won&#039;t just blow up in a hysterical laughing fit), that seems big enough a goal achieved. If you take technical know-how as well, great. But really, making sure you&#039;re okay is the more important goal it seems you need to achieve.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Amy - aww, thanks for your concern!  A lot of the stress is probably self-made - I want, nay *need*, to challenge myself and learn a lot in this semester otherwise I&#039;ll really disappoint myself.  I&#039;m sure I could take it easy and float on by, but I would just hate myself.
To get the outcome I want, it&#039;s just going to take a long long time...]]></description>
