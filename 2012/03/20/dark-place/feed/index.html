		<description><![CDATA[I have had depression twice now -.-&#039; the first time was at high school due to bullying and the second over something in my past brought up again. from the first bout I discovered that strength is hard and there is an ending even if you can&#039;t see it. (I continued on to A levels and uni) 
the second I learnt that you can&#039;t deal with these things alone even if you have before.
My advice? Phone up a friend and talk, doesn&#039;t matter what about, every-time you feel sad you know you have someone who will cheer you up; everyone does. Don&#039;t work day to day because it will not end well, try to set things to look forward too.
Also I agree with Pingu; if you&#039;re a note-taker then take notes but only take the ones you choose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You can find strength in the darkness.  But so did Senator Palpatine. It will change you. Incidently, about the &quot;wonderful&quot; group you&#039;re in? If you become the keeper of notes, the go-to girl, you help steer the direction your group is heading in, as no-one in any meeting will remember exactly what was said, or exactly what was agreed. Personally? Right now the Dark Side right now is your ally, because the shiftless and noncomittal aren&#039;t going to do anything except what pleases them, and they *will* drag you down.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Been there, done that. Got the t-shirt. Didn&#039;t come in my size.


Beat the everliving crap out of what tried to keep me there. Dug through guts to reach glory. Keep fighting to float above. Only selectively care. Haven&#039;t allowed myself to be weak and feel crappy since.]]></description>
