		<description><![CDATA[Hi Glass Urchin or simply Ami. I like your comic. Why? It&#039;s a story. A story of life. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad and sometimes warm. I like mostly that warm comfortable feeling you create when I&#039;m reading your comic. It consists of family, friendship and home. That is the reason I&#039;am still with you. Wait did I write down what I really wanted to say? I often lost myself in my thoughts. Anyway lets continue. I was always charmed with different cultures different countries like USA, Japan or somwhere else. You gave me oportunity to step into your world at least for a short time. I crossed in my mind that long distance between our contries and experienced finally something new. Thanks. By the way I&#039;m from Slovakia which is a neightbouring contry with Poland. Don&#039;t mix it up with Slowenia please. And from a small city or rather town Nové Zámky which would be probably translated as New Castles. I am lazy, little bit sellfish, dreamer, not anymore funny, few years frustrated, well your ordinary everyday guy. (I&#039;m trying to show myself in a bad nature. People wont expect much from me in that way.) Ok lets see: why I read check, who I am check, from where I am check. Ok I think it is everthing, so I&#039;m gonna end this, kind of awkward, comment. Thank you for your hard work again and bye. Your reader Jack.

P.s. By the way sorry for any mistakes in this comment. Not my usual everyday language.]]></description>
