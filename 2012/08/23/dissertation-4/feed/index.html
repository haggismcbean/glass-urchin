		<description><![CDATA[School sometimes makes you contemplate everything. Spend some time contemplating not so many things. It&#039;s okay to stop thinking sometimes, I think.
Also, thanks for making this comic. I really appreciate the way you chronicle life, no matter what. It takes courage (and lots of other things, I&#039;m sure), so thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s nothing like Purpose: http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2002/06/08
Okay. Time to stop kidding. You do have a purpose which you may or may not know about yet, I think. But even if I&#039;m wrong, what stops you from accepting life as one big work &amp; travel journey, enjoying yourself doing otherwise pointless things just because you want to, visiting must-see places and sometimes doing work just for the money if you have to?
Have a fantastic week. :)]]></description>
