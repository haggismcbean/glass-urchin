		<description><![CDATA[A dissertation is not simply a &quot;super long essay&quot;. It is the final written form of everything the student has learnt and worked towards, condensed and captured into a written document. It&#039;s something in which the student has poured heart, body and soul, possibly for *years*, hoping that all the blood, sweat and tears can be expressed by mere words. The capstone to everything that came before. The Final Project. The Big One. Am I making myself a little clearer now?]]></description>
