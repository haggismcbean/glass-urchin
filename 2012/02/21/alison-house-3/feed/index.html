		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t cook for you or feed you something healthy (living on deep-frozen pizza and yoghurt drinks myself). I can&#039;t do your work or help you do it. I can&#039;t grab you and drag you to a doctor&#039;s about that nose bleed. And, sadly, I can&#039;t just give you a big hug. But I can tell you to take care of yourself, and that you will make it and be just fine if you do. 
Here&#039;s a big bunch of faith in you, attached to a get-well salad bowl ;) Comic can wait. If it helps you, draw. If it&#039;s just more pressure, don&#039;t. We&#039;ll be right here, just in case.]]></description>
