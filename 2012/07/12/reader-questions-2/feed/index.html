		<description><![CDATA[@Mel - Hahah - it&#039;s just drawn directly into the computer. Actually these take significantly less time because I don&#039;t have to physically draw anything, thus I don&#039;t have to plan it out or lay it out/measure it, put real text to it, scan it in, touch it up, etc. It&#039;s a lot faster for me to do it this way anyway, though i&#039;ll tone it down with the colours.]]></description>
