		<description><![CDATA[To be honest, once I saw Advent Children I was completely turned off by the whole FFVII spin-offs, and I have never played any of the sequel games. My favourites have to be the cameo appearances by FF characters in Kingdom Hearts, because it&#039;s usually kept casual and without overblowing their plight.
However, I really think the humour and innocence of the original FFVII game was kind of tossed to the wayside when Square discovered &quot;good graphics,&quot; and everything I see nowadays has so much of that wistful staring into the middle distance that annoys me so much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Auilix, can you stuff the genie back in the bottle? Or is the beach littered with different kinds of genies? Anyway, did you get any of the other games and films built around FF VII? (I, for my sins, still have Dirge of Cerberus, Crisis Core AND Advent Children. Advent Children!).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Pingu - For me, since FFVII, there are many games that have captured the wonder, depth, and beauty of my first playthroughs of FFVII, including: Shadow of Colossus, Final Fantasy XII, the Suikoden series, and Xenogears to name a few (also, I did very much enjoy VIII and IX). But you&#039;re right - there was a time and a place for FFVII in my life and it had to come at that point. If it was any later I could see regarding it as simple, but it hit a chord with me then because it was so right for me at that point.

Agree on the idea of a remake too. While I enjoy seeing some clips here and there done in that new style, Cloud and the others really excel at showing their personalities off as tiny little cubes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was working in Germany when this came out. I bought it in German, finished it, then when I went home I bought it in English, finished it. Squeenix has never been able to capture again what they did with FF VII... and quite frankly, even if they did spent a lotta money and dd a HD remake, it wouldn&#039;t be the same. FF VII was right time, right place for then. Not now.]]></description>
