		<description><![CDATA[So, there&#039;s a fair amount of mention of Edinburgh weather in the comic. If you had to be stuck with only one of our weather types forever more, which would it be?

If you think they CAN work, do you think the distance filters the possibly bad relationships from the good, or on the contrary, doesn&#039;t allow those relationships to fully bloom?

Also; did you ever think you had a super power, just to realize it was pretty common? When I was in kindergarten I thought that my myodeopsia were little aliens flying around and that I was the only one that could see them.]]></description>
