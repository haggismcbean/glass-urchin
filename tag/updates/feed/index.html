				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey all!  I&#8217;m sure you noticed my announcement at the top of the page (or not if you&#8217;re subscribed to my feed I suppose&#8230;.).  </p>
<p>Yes, I do intend to temporarily move to thrice weekly.  I hope this isn&#8217;t going to confuse everyone in the world&#8230;  I just wanted to get the storyline moving because I realized it would take me until September to tell the whole story I want to tell, just because the pages will be released so slowly.  </p>
<p>So!  I&#8217;m going to give a <del datetime="2009-06-23T16:54:32+00:00">MWF</del> MTTh schedule a try.  What I&#8217;m going to do is try <del datetime="2009-06-23T16:54:32+00:00">MWF</del> MTTh next week, and then back to TTh the week after.  Please let me know how you feel about that alternating week format (I know it&#8217;s annoying), and I&#8217;ll see if I want to continue it in that manner.  This way, pages get up faster and I&#8217;ll get my story arc done sometime this year.  Haha&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I decided it might be easier to just to a Monday &#8211; Tuesday &#8211; Thursday update, for those of you that come to my page on those days anyway.  I&#8217;ll see how it works with this schedule instead.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it seems I haven&#8217;t really updated this bloggish type area in a long while!  Over a month (just a little!).  Many apologies.  Things have been going on and it&#8217;s crazy times.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s new in my life?  I&#8217;ve been fostering a <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=12990229">cute stray calico</a>; experimenting with new kinds of art involving ink brushes, bristol paper, and tones (so check out updates to my <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/a-gallery/">art gallery</a>); and last weekend I got to hang with webcomicker Ross of <a href="http://www.notquitewrong.com/rosscottinc/">The System</a> and some old and new friends all night long.  I&#8217;ve generally been quite busy and between the kitty and Frey&#8217;s running wheel breaking down and squeaking all night, I&#8217;ve also had a huge lack of sleep.  So if my comics have been terse or sparse, now you know why!</p>
<p>In other news, I apoligize for not sharing these great fanart-type pieces with you sooner!  From <a href="http://spiffy-keen.com/">Shade</a> comes a beautiful xmas gift <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/a-gallery/?px=%2FGlassUrchinFanart%2Fxmas_hedgie_byshade.jpg">illustration</a> (love the bristly painted look and texture!), from friend and previous co-worker <a href="http://rayuen.com/">Ray</a> comes a piece on the other end of the spectrum with hard lines and tones that&#8217;s <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/a-gallery/?px=%2FGlassUrchinFanart%2Frayfanart.jpg">cute and simple</a>, and from webcomicker <a href="http://jhorsley3.com/">Jhorsley</a> of <a href="http://y2clcomic.com/">Y2CL</a> comes a neat <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/a-gallery/?px=%2FGlassUrchinFanart%2Fglassurchinfanart_byjhorsley.jpg">fanart</a> drawn on the back of a comic page!!  Thanks all!  They&#8217;re freakin&#8217; awesome!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I totally updated the <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/about/">About page</a> today!  Oh my!  Fancy new pics and more character bios!  And if it turns out I have crazy free time (read &#8211; 2 hours of personal time, yay!) like this again, you can expect me to add those wallpapers and banners like I&#8217;ve always wanted to do (but never got around to doing).  I think I&#8217;m getting better at this&#8230;  I think I might try to put on some ads for The GU around, and we shall see how that goes.  In the meantime, please do keep clicking on the Rubifruit banner on the right, and the numbered stuff on the bottom of the page to boost my rankings!  </p>
<p>Also, hope you guys had a great holiday!  I didn&#8217;t get many extravagant things, but everything I got I liked/wanted/needed!  I&#8217;ll be uploading some pictures of my haul as soon as I find and unpack my camera&#8230;  Ah, my new place is such a mess!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all &#8211; Just to keep you all posted on life and my current situation, I just want to let everyone know that it&#8217;s been very busy lately.  Along with keeping up with both <a href="http://www.superbarracuda.com">Super Barracuda!</a> and The Glass Urchin, I&#8217;ve been really busy as well.  You&#8217;ve now seen that I&#8217;ve been accepted at a very neat company and I now have a <a hrf="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/2008/10/07/job-1/">job</a>, since about mid-September.  I&#8217;ve been trying to squeeze in all the comics I need to do along with work and everything else, but bear with me if anything does lag behind (I hope it won&#8217;t get to that though).  I also have some small health concerns that have been afflicting me&#8230;  But now that I have a job, health care will soon follow, thank goodness.</p>
<p>In addition to everything, my little kitty of 12 years (I could&#8217;ve sworn we&#8217;ve been together for longer!), Ashes, has been having a lot of health problems.  She lives at my parent&#8217;s home and I&#8217;ve not been able to spend as much time at home now that I have work.  I wish I could help my mom take care of her, it&#8217;s a huge burden and she&#8217;s been doing everything mostly on her own.  I&#8217;m afraid that it might be the end and every time I get a chance to do home, despite everyone&#8217;s best attempts, she&#8217;s been getting frailer and frailer.  It&#8217;s depressing to see her so small and feeble, and I only see her briefly so I can&#8217;t imagine what mom must be going through.  </p>
<p>So just bear with me, everyone.  I promise I&#8217;ll do everything to keep updating The Glass Urchin, but I might not have such a big presence online for a while.  </p>
