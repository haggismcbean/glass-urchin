My job (as comicked <a href="/glass-urchin/2008/10/09/job-2/">here</a>) has gotten crazy-go-nuts, but I guess that means I won&#8217;t get laid off.  And another plus, I&#8217;m moving in a month!  Horay!  (although I wonder if that will make me any less busy&#8230;  * looks around for guests comics shiftily*)  Seriously though, if anyone would like to/are inspired to draw me a guest comic for sometime in the month of December, it would be greatly appreciated because I know I&#8217;ll be very busy trying to keep up with moving, work, art, and the holidays. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to take this time to thank the awesome guys at <a href="http://icantdrawfeet.com/">I Can&#8217;t Draw Feet</a> for giving me a great <a href="http://icantdrawfeet.com/2008/11/20/the-glass-urchin/">shout out</a> today!  Their comic is just wonderfully hilarious and well done &#8211; I&#8217;m flattered that talented writers and artists might find The Glass Urchin likable.  I would say to check out their webcomic, but I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;ve already read it on your own or have come to The GU through their webpage.  </p>
<p>I still miss my Ashes&#8230;  Coming home home isn&#8217;t the same without you to greet me at the door.  </p>
