Because when you&#8217;re fluent in another language, the best thing to do is interject some words here and there at random from your native tongue.  </p>
<p>I like the use of wee, it kind of makes sense!</p>

Just putting out a disclaimer here that I&#8217;m not trying to joke about suicide right here.  Again, I apologize for bringing depression so much in the comics that it worries my close family and friends.  As I heard on a news clip about depression not having a job (did I mention I just got laid off?), one woman put it that she may wake up some days and think &#8220;What&#8217;s it all for&#8221; and &#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221; but she wouldn&#8217;t consider the other way an actual option.  </p>
<p>Anyway, so apparently Shivi&#8217;s boyfriend knows all the best ways to do it.  Leave it to the med school kids to be all technical about stuff like that!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So a lot of shit has happened to me since I started this comic <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/2008/07/01/the-beginning/">two years ago</a>.  Not only has my art changed quite a bit, but so has my life!  I&#8217;ve lived in five different places since I started this, had two different and weird jobs, plus two periods of unemployment, made tons of toys, and played god knows how many video games.  Life has all taken us far, and I wanted to thank you, the reader, for sticking with me this whole time.  I sometimes wonder why I do what I do, but I&#8217;ve gotten so much support lately, not just from friends and family, but from readers who really care.  It&#8217;s really flattering!  (not that the unique hits you give me isn&#8217;t flattering!)</p>
<p>So next week I have a nice treat planned out &#8211; updates and comics from characters from The Glass Urchin!  That&#8217;s right, the real people who have been in this comic will be making their own comic stories and it&#8217;ll be a week-long GU celebration.  It&#8217;ll also give me some much needed rest, after which I&#8217;ll be back again with updates and fun in the second week of July.</p>
<p>Want to see what little sister Mel wrote about me in her diary?  How about the exciting &#8220;art&#8221; Harri and I saw last month?  Tune in next week for those comics and more!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first <a href="http://www.wildpigcomics.com/pigcon.html">Wild Pig Con</a> is in the bag!  It was a little difficult to make sales there, given there was a HUGE 50% off sale (on all new graphic novels, books, etc. seriously) going on right in front of our tables, but it was still a great deal of fun!</p>
<p>Firstly I shared a table with <a href="http://www.clairemation.com/">Claire</a> this time, and it was fun!  I think we dorked out quite a bit.  Out neighbor was the great <a href="http://www.dernwerks.com/">Dern!</a> who I haven&#8217;t seen since SPX, but who is always fun to table with/near.  I also played my first actual battles with an actual person in my Soul Silver with him.  Yay!  I tried continuing down the row to meet and socialize with some others, who mainly seemed to be webcomickers.  I met <a href="http://www.digitalpimponline.com/">Joe and Phil</a> who are (I didn&#8217;t know this) both sorta local guys!  They were selling their wares but also were participating in the Wild Pig <a href="http://www.superartfight.com/">Super Art Fight!</a>  More on that later&#8230;  Moving along, I met Brian of <a href="http://boxbrown.com/">Bellen!</a>, who I talked to about quitting your job, taking classes, and living in Jersey City.  He currently lives in Philly but lived in Jersey City for five years!  Nice!  The next table over had our friends Kevin and Blondie, who do <a href="http://www.caf-fiends.net/comicpress/">Caf-fiends</a>!  They&#8217;re talking me into showing up at <a href="http://connecticon.org/">Connecticon</a>, it&#8217;s supposed to be THE webcomics show, so at the very least us NERDs might be able to visit for a day!  Then a table over held Caldwell of <a href="http://www.loldwell.com/">Loldwell</a>, who had to brave the NJ Transit bus system to get to Wild Pig!  Then Jamie Hatton, the dude who introduced us all to this, of <a href="http://www.inhislikeness.com/">In His Likeness</a> was tabling next.  He has two <a href="http://www.inhislikeness.com/pre-sale/">neat compilation books</a> out now!  After Jamie, the <a href="http://www.notquitewrong.com/rosscottinc/">Systemic</a> Rosscott had some hip shirts and other merch for sale.  Rounding the corner was the <a href="http://www.superartfight.com/">Super Art Fight</a> table with our friends Nick and Marty.  And I didn&#8217;t make it to the other tables after that (and thank goodness, because this was enough recap for one post!).</p>
<p>Some other cool people who stopped by our table includes: Bernie from <a href="http://alienlovespredator.com/">Alien Loves Predator</a>, Valerie from <a href="http://friendsoflulu.wordpress.com/">Friends of Lulu</a>, and Gary of <a href="http://www.fleen.com/">Fleen</a>!  It was great to see and/or meet you!  ;P</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.superartfight.com/">Super Art Fight</a> was the first one I&#8217;ve been to, but has been going on for a while now.  I loved it!  It was very excitingin and I&#8217;m surprised at what quality work these artists can do from a standing position, with a crowd staring/yelling, with two sharpies and poster board in 30 minutes.  It was great stuff and I hope to be at the next Super Art Fight event to cheer everyone on!</p>
<p>Many thanks to the gracious hosts of <a href="http://www.wildpigcomics.com/pigcon.html">Wild Pig Con</a> who were a lot more accommodating and organized than most other cons I&#8217;ve been to.  You guys are awesome!</p>
