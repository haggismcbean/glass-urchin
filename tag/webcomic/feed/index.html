				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;ve been hard at work guys, and I know I warned <a href="/glass-urchin/2011/09/29/quality-may-suffer/">y&#8217;all</a> previously, but it&#8217;s really been crunch time for me this whole past month. Been working really hard on design and modelling and animation stuff, will hopefully have something good to share at the end of the semester. But a heads up that comics may lag behind, hopefully not soon but it might be inevitable!</p>
<p>Oh and on a break from work I took one of those gif memes that have been floating around and this one I hope will be really accurate:<br />
&#8220;The tenth is how you will spend your last day on earth&#8221;<br />

YES PLEASE!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wish this was a post introducing a line of cuddly real-life stuffed hedgehog toys, but alas you&#8217;ll have to do with the next best thing &#8211; Ami starring as a very cute plushy iteration in the webcomic <a href="http://www.plusonecomic.com/">Plus One</a>!!!  She (I?) makes her stitched debut <a href="http://www.plusonecomic.com/2011/07/ami-the-hedgehog/">here</a>, as the titular character&#8217;s new toy!  Plus One is an endearing webcomic about an interesting and new life journey.  And hey, just like it was recently Anna&#8217;s birthday, it was also the birthday of The Glass Urchin a couple of days ago, so this comes as a nice GU birthday treat!  Thanks Dustin!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I did a guest comic for <a href="http://www.sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/">Bree&#8217;s</a> newer comic projects <a href="http://nerdcomics.com/mysterious/">Mysterious Ways, Inc.</a>, and you can <a href="http://nerdcomics.com/mysterious/2010/08/11/guestbyami/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1109" title="mwiguest" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mwiguest.png" alt="" width="171" height="196" /></a>check it out <a href="http://nerdcomics.com/mysterious/2010/08/11/guestbyami/">here!</a> If you haven&#8217;t been following MWI, it&#8217;s a neat take on the deities we all know and love &#8211; it&#8217;s still finding its footing but there&#8217;s a good archive up so please check it out!  It&#8217;s fun to draw people sometimes&#8230;  Sometimes I think I get a little carried away because they show up so rarely in my own comic!  I had fun drawing Bree&#8217;s Gaia character &#8211; I like her old school desi<a href="http://happyhourcomic.com/?p=1229"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1110" title="happyhrguest" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/happyhrguest.png" alt="" width="103" height="184" /></a>gn!  Please do read through the archives of MWI when you get there as it&#8217;s a fun and quick read.  I hope to see more Gaia soon too!</p>
<p>I also forgot to post this but I did another guest comic (involving people too! &#8230;but also cute fluffy animals) for a fellow New Jerseyan and Rutgers alum who does the long-running webcomic and print comic <a href="http://happyhourcomic.com/">Happy Hour!</a> Jim was celebrating his 1000th comic!  Wow!  Glass Urchin still has a long way to go.  But you can see the comic I did for him <a href="http://happyhourcomic.com/?p=1229">here</a>!  Please check it out if you have time!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first <a href="http://www.wildpigcomics.com/pigcon.html">Wild Pig Con</a> is in the bag!  It was a little difficult to make sales there, given there was a HUGE 50% off sale (on all new graphic novels, books, etc. seriously) going on right in front of our tables, but it was still a great deal of fun!</p>
<p>Firstly I shared a table with <a href="http://www.clairemation.com/">Claire</a> this time, and it was fun!  I think we dorked out quite a bit.  Out neighbor was the great <a href="http://www.dernwerks.com/">Dern!</a> who I haven&#8217;t seen since SPX, but who is always fun to table with/near.  I also played my first actual battles with an actual person in my Soul Silver with him.  Yay!  I tried continuing down the row to meet and socialize with some others, who mainly seemed to be webcomickers.  I met <a href="http://www.digitalpimponline.com/">Joe and Phil</a> who are (I didn&#8217;t know this) both sorta local guys!  They were selling their wares but also were participating in the Wild Pig <a href="http://www.superartfight.com/">Super Art Fight!</a>  More on that later&#8230;  Moving along, I met Brian of <a href="http://boxbrown.com/">Bellen!</a>, who I talked to about quitting your job, taking classes, and living in Jersey City.  He currently lives in Philly but lived in Jersey City for five years!  Nice!  The next table over had our friends Kevin and Blondie, who do <a href="http://www.caf-fiends.net/comicpress/">Caf-fiends</a>!  They&#8217;re talking me into showing up at <a href="http://connecticon.org/">Connecticon</a>, it&#8217;s supposed to be THE webcomics show, so at the very least us NERDs might be able to visit for a day!  Then a table over held Caldwell of <a href="http://www.loldwell.com/">Loldwell</a>, who had to brave the NJ Transit bus system to get to Wild Pig!  Then Jamie Hatton, the dude who introduced us all to this, of <a href="http://www.inhislikeness.com/">In His Likeness</a> was tabling next.  He has two <a href="http://www.inhislikeness.com/pre-sale/">neat compilation books</a> out now!  After Jamie, the <a href="http://www.notquitewrong.com/rosscottinc/">Systemic</a> Rosscott had some hip shirts and other merch for sale.  Rounding the corner was the <a href="http://www.superartfight.com/">Super Art Fight</a> table with our friends Nick and Marty.  And I didn&#8217;t make it to the other tables after that (and thank goodness, because this was enough recap for one post!).</p>
<p>Some other cool people who stopped by our table includes: Bernie from <a href="http://alienlovespredator.com/">Alien Loves Predator</a>, Valerie from <a href="http://friendsoflulu.wordpress.com/">Friends of Lulu</a>, and Gary of <a href="http://www.fleen.com/">Fleen</a>!  It was great to see and/or meet you!  ;P</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.superartfight.com/">Super Art Fight</a> was the first one I&#8217;ve been to, but has been going on for a while now.  I loved it!  It was very excitingin and I&#8217;m surprised at what quality work these artists can do from a standing position, with a crowd staring/yelling, with two sharpies and poster board in 30 minutes.  It was great stuff and I hope to be at the next Super Art Fight event to cheer everyone on!</p>
<p>Many thanks to the gracious hosts of <a href="http://www.wildpigcomics.com/pigcon.html">Wild Pig Con</a> who were a lot more accommodating and organized than most other cons I&#8217;ve been to.  You guys are awesome!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys, so now we&#8217;re about halfway through the <a href="/glass-urchin/2009/06/16/senior-year-1/">New Brunswick Saga</a>.  Yes, <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-499" title="newbrunsmelt" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/newbrunsmelt1.png" alt="newbrunsmelt" width="155" height="283" />halfway through!  Now that we&#8217;re at this spot, I&#8217;d like to get some feedback from you, the reader.  What do you think of my first continuing storyline, the New Brunswick Saga?  Love it?  Hate it?  Mildly have no opinion on it either way?  Let me know in this poll, or write feedback in the comments (or both!).  I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on this story type setting versus my old gag-a-day format.  Vote away!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m trying to put out a compilation book on all the pages, plus the entire New Brunswick Saga in completion, by this September.  Can I do it?  We shall have to see.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m looking for quotes.  You know, the quotes you see on the back of the book or in the dust jacket of books.  Like something related to how you feel about The Glass Urchin, things like &#8220;a spikéd tour de force&#8221; and other artsy things that you&#8217;re never really sure of what they mean, but they sound good and make you want to read more.  Answer in the comments here if you have anything to input, and I might choose yours!  I&#8217;ll probably select only a couple of quotes (planning on also putting a bit of a summary/introduction on the back), but any and all quotes are welcome!  If you have a URL to your webcomic, put that as well.  If you don&#8217;t have a webcomic or company, you could always make up something up!  Negative comments, if you want to be a big meanie, are welcome too.</p>
<p>You might see <i>your</i> quote on the very first book of The Glass Urchin!!!</p>
