				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bree and I had an awesome weekend at <a href="http://www.brooklynlyceum.com/">Brooklyn Lyceum&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.kingconbrooklyn.com/">KingCon</a>, thanks to all who stopped by!  I think Bree summed up the craziness that was this past weekend with this (very real) comic about how it made us accidentally run in the <a href="http://www.sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/2010/11/08/11082010/">NY Marathon</a>.  Anyway it was great meeting all of you, and sorry if I seemed out of it &#8211; it&#8217;s just the usual con wear and tear.  Rifling through the stuff I picked up, I met <a href="http://www.megan-brennan.com">Megan Brennan</a>, who I traded for a cute mini &#8220;Melvin Lampius Saves the Day!&#8221; (I love the art and colouring style!), <a href="http://www.mmm-hmm.com">Kevin Shelley</a>, who had a beautifully presented book called Mmm-Hmm, <a href="http://firstlawofmadscience.com/">Mike Isenberg</a>, who I had met at NYCC but then met again at KingCon and who gave me a sample of his book, <a href="http://glitchworks.com/">Tim Piotrowski</a> who had beautiful new editions of his great book about the Kool Aid Man, <a href="http://www.thelindo.com/">Sara and Steve</a>, who I should have realized earlier were from my neck of the woods (sorry!), and <a href="http://www.jamietanner.com/">Jamie Tanner</a>, whose work is just beautiful (I need to buy me some prints next time).  Phew!  We also hung out with some of our good friends who do <a href="http://tapirtooth.blogspot.com/">Tapir Tooth</a>: <a href="http://andreatsurumi.com/">Andrea</a>, <a href="http://www.miriamgibson.com/">Miriam</a>, <a href="http://www.peterquach.com/">Peter</a>, and Blu-jay, as well as our usual crowd of comic and art friends.  Gah!  Sorry if I forgot anyone!</p>
<p>We were also interviewed by <a href="http://jimmyaquino.typepad.com/">Jimmy Aquino</a> at <a href="http://www.comicnewsinsider.com">Comic News Insider</a>, and the full interview, plus interviews with other talented artists at the con can be heard <a href="http://www.jimmyaquino.typepad.com/comicnewsinsider/2010/11/episode-303-king-con-with-abede-lovelace-bree-rubin-ami-bogan-fred-chao-jamie-tanner-jonathan-baylis.html">here</a>!!!  He interviewed Bree and I as well as some other talented folks who tabled at <a href="http://www.kingconbrooklyn.com/">KingCon</a>.  He also picked up a copy of my first book and gave it a really nice review nearing the end of the podcast.  Please give it a listen!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys, so I apologize for not yet posting any recaps for <a href="http://interventioncon.com/">Intervention</a> or <a href="http://www.spxpo.com/">Small Press Expo</a> yet, it was a super busy weekend and a busy subsequent week!  I promise you&#8217;ll see something up soon on here and <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/">NERD Comics</a>.  In a nutshell, it was a great weekend and was a lot of fun meeting new fans and comickers and hanging out with old friends.</p>
<p>I just wanted to take the time to let you know that there&#8217;s been a bunch of new product I&#8217;ve been working on but due to the <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/">NERD Comics</a> shop being a bit under the weather (should have it up this month or so), I haven&#8217;t been able to post them anywhere online.  If you are interested in anything you see here, please feel free to send me an email and I&#8217;ll see if I can arrange something via paypal as a temporary solution!  I know a lot of you have been asking at cons and stuff, so I thought I should at least post something.</p>
<p>First up, I have two t-shirts (one charcoal and one turquoise) in my 2Player &lt;3 Style, available in girl&#8217;s and boy&#8217;s sizes from Small to XL.  One can be yours for $20 each!  Some of these I screenprinted myself!  I had a lot of fun with this design and it went over well at the cons it debuted at this summer.</p>
<p><a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2Plove.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1178" title="2Plove" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2Plove-300x259.png" alt="" width="300" height="259" /></a></p>
<p>Next, some brand new acrylic earrings!  These are really adorable, and the pictures I took don&#8217;t really do them any justice.  I made two designs &#8211; one incorporating the classic SNES controllers to go with the 2P Love shirt, and the other incorporating ME!  That&#8217;s right you can have two cute hedgepogs dangling off your ears for only $12 a pair!  Or if you buy a pair each of the controllers and the hedgehogs, I&#8217;ll give them to you for $20.</p>
<p><a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/gu-earrings.gif"><img title="gu-earrings" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/gu-earrings-300x201.gif" alt="" width="300" height="201" align="left" /></a><a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/gu-earrings2.gif"><img title="gu-earrings2" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/gu-earrings2.gif" alt="" width="177" height="288" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/?p=1105"><img title="Darwin" src="http://www.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/darwin-264x300.png" alt="" align="left" /></a>The last new product I have available is actually a NERD collective product- our very first anthology, Darwin!  <a href="http://www.sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/">Bree</a> and I put these books together and we both contributed stories in it.  You can check out some small clips of it, as well as further information a list of the talented artists and writers who joined us <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/?p=1105">here</a>!</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</span></p>
<p>Aaaaanyway, hopefully good sales can continue online as my scanner just broke.  It&#8217;s going to be difficult posting comics, but you know I&#8217;ll find a way to keep them coming!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first <a href="http://www.wildpigcomics.com/pigcon.html">Wild Pig Con</a> is in the bag!  It was a little difficult to make sales there, given there was a HUGE 50% off sale (on all new graphic novels, books, etc. seriously) going on right in front of our tables, but it was still a great deal of fun!</p>
<p>Firstly I shared a table with <a href="http://www.clairemation.com/">Claire</a> this time, and it was fun!  I think we dorked out quite a bit.  Out neighbor was the great <a href="http://www.dernwerks.com/">Dern!</a> who I haven&#8217;t seen since SPX, but who is always fun to table with/near.  I also played my first actual battles with an actual person in my Soul Silver with him.  Yay!  I tried continuing down the row to meet and socialize with some others, who mainly seemed to be webcomickers.  I met <a href="http://www.digitalpimponline.com/">Joe and Phil</a> who are (I didn&#8217;t know this) both sorta local guys!  They were selling their wares but also were participating in the Wild Pig <a href="http://www.superartfight.com/">Super Art Fight!</a>  More on that later&#8230;  Moving along, I met Brian of <a href="http://boxbrown.com/">Bellen!</a>, who I talked to about quitting your job, taking classes, and living in Jersey City.  He currently lives in Philly but lived in Jersey City for five years!  Nice!  The next table over had our friends Kevin and Blondie, who do <a href="http://www.caf-fiends.net/comicpress/">Caf-fiends</a>!  They&#8217;re talking me into showing up at <a href="http://connecticon.org/">Connecticon</a>, it&#8217;s supposed to be THE webcomics show, so at the very least us NERDs might be able to visit for a day!  Then a table over held Caldwell of <a href="http://www.loldwell.com/">Loldwell</a>, who had to brave the NJ Transit bus system to get to Wild Pig!  Then Jamie Hatton, the dude who introduced us all to this, of <a href="http://www.inhislikeness.com/">In His Likeness</a> was tabling next.  He has two <a href="http://www.inhislikeness.com/pre-sale/">neat compilation books</a> out now!  After Jamie, the <a href="http://www.notquitewrong.com/rosscottinc/">Systemic</a> Rosscott had some hip shirts and other merch for sale.  Rounding the corner was the <a href="http://www.superartfight.com/">Super Art Fight</a> table with our friends Nick and Marty.  And I didn&#8217;t make it to the other tables after that (and thank goodness, because this was enough recap for one post!).</p>
<p>Some other cool people who stopped by our table includes: Bernie from <a href="http://alienlovespredator.com/">Alien Loves Predator</a>, Valerie from <a href="http://friendsoflulu.wordpress.com/">Friends of Lulu</a>, and Gary of <a href="http://www.fleen.com/">Fleen</a>!  It was great to see and/or meet you!  ;P</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.superartfight.com/">Super Art Fight</a> was the first one I&#8217;ve been to, but has been going on for a while now.  I loved it!  It was very excitingin and I&#8217;m surprised at what quality work these artists can do from a standing position, with a crowd staring/yelling, with two sharpies and poster board in 30 minutes.  It was great stuff and I hope to be at the next Super Art Fight event to cheer everyone on!</p>
<p>Many thanks to the gracious hosts of <a href="http://www.wildpigcomics.com/pigcon.html">Wild Pig Con</a> who were a lot more accommodating and organized than most other cons I&#8217;ve been to.  You guys are awesome!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well I know I don&#8217;t usually announce my con appearances until, uhmm, the week ahead of time, but I <em>have</em> to tell you about <a href="http://interventioncon.com/">Intervention </a><a href="http://interventioncon.com/">Con!</a> That&#8217;s because yours truly and <a href="http://sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/">Bree</a> will be guests at this great new show.</p>
<p>Do you like webcomics?  Do you like humor?  Do you like the <strong>internet</strong>?  Then Intervention Con is the con for you.  It features a bevy of awesome webcomickers and bloggers, and it&#8217;s hosted by the webcomic greats <a href="http://www.onezumi.com/">Onezumi</a> and <a href="http://www.awsom.org/">Harknell</a>!  It&#8217;s taking place on September 10 &#8211; 12 down in the DC area.  Check the site for all the details, as pre-reg is still open!</p>
<p>The dates are the same as this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.spxpo.com/">SPX</a> but no worries &#8211; it&#8217;s in the same location as well!  If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to meet all your print comic or webcomic artists in one weekend, then you&#8217;d better pick this one!  If you&#8217;re an artist or a vendor, Intervention Con may also have a space for you at a better price and better service than most other cons can say.  So check it out now!  And BTW &#8211; if you&#8217;re looking for when us NERDs will be appearing at a con, look no further than the <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/">NERD Comics</a> homepage, which lists all our appearances this year!  I look forward to seeing you at the next con!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.moccany.com/content/mocca-festival">MoCCA Fest</a> was a lot more relaxing and fun, and most importantly, a lot cooler.  None of us were boiled to a crisp like last year, and I think that was good for all of us, buyers and vendors alike.  I saw a lot of people, so sorry if I seemed a little out of it.  It was a little hard to keep up with everyone and who knows who/who does what (I&#8217;m sure much much harder for those famous types who get tons of fans coming to their table all the time!).  People should wear their art on themselves (actually this does work for me &#8211; when I do a Glass Urchin doodle on my badge, I feel people &#8220;recognize&#8221; me a lot easier).</p>
<p>Anyway <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/">NERD Comics</a> kicked off this MoCCA, like last time, with <a href="http://hopelarson.com/">Hope Larson&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://drawlikealady.com/">Drink &amp; Draw like a Lady</a> event in Chelsea(ish) on Friday.  It was cool and, like MoCCA itself, improved from last year!  We had ample lighting (maybe too much lighting?), and it wasn&#8217;t red.  We weren&#8217;t in a loud and crowded bar (but a loud and crowded book store).  And there wasn&#8217;t a singles mixer happening at the same location!  So no guys snuck in this time!  <img src='http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' />   At DDLL, I met some other cool people to chat with and some other artists!  We met <a href="http://1979semifinalist.wordpress.com/">Kelly Thompson</a> who does CBR&#8217;s <a href="http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/author/kelly-thompson/">&#8220;She Has No Head!&#8221;</a> column.  She said she didn&#8217;t have time to get business cards, so she instead draw all her business cards&#8230;  Besides that not making much sense, I got a cute little Lucy Van Pelt illustrated card from her <img src='http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .  We also met <a href="http://gingercurls.wordpress.com/">Tara O&#8217;Connor</a> who had cute little business cards and cool looking comics I must check out.  Diana Mallery (links?!?) gave me a very neat comic called Singularity, which was awesome, especially for having been made the day before.  Jenn (and we later met more of Jenn&#8217;s cool friends at the table) of <a href="http://www.runliljared.com/">Run Lil&#8217; Jared</a> gave me a new comic called Mimolette Bakery (that had beautiful colored pencil art!).  It was very adorable&#8230; I just love the cake decorating business in that Ace of Cakes fangirl style, so I think a comic set in a bakery would be just awesome!  The <a href="http://www.sodapopcomicspr.com/Home.html">Soda Pop Comics</a> people gave us a very cute mini minis, mine was about a lonely astronaut.  Lastly, Bree and I gave Hope Larson one of Bree&#8217;s Self Aware Totes filled with some minis as thanks for putting on DDLL again this year!</p>
<p>Then on Saturday came MoCCA!  The room was cool and it started on time&#8230;  Totally different from last year!  And speaking of which, our table was actually very well set up and neat for once!  We consolidated and pooled our books together and got it much better organized!  Plus Bree had made a quite large NERD tablecloth which made us stand out even more.  At our table was the usual <a href="http://www.sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/">Bree</a> n&#8217; me, but we were also joined by <a href="http://www.clairemation.com/">Claire</a> and, eventually, <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/dingle/">Foley</a>.  Claire had a great little mini called &#8220;The Last Artist on Earth,&#8221; which I can&#8217;t believe was a 24-hour comic because it was so well put together!  I highly recommend it!  <img class="alignright" src="http://www.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/clairecover.gif" alt="Claire's mini" width="197" height="288" align="right" />Our neighbors were the famous <a href="http://www.chrisyates.net/">Chris Yates</a> and <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/">R. Stevens</a>!  We also met <a href="http://www.fleen.com/">Gary</a> briefly as he manned the table for them.  And we were at the end of the aisle, but luckily not at an end cap (those are always annoying spots to be in).  On Saturday I didn&#8217;t do much buying, but I mostly browsed and scoped out the many many cool artwork and books available at the con.  There&#8217;s really so much at MoCCA to see!  I especially oogled over <a href="http://www.stickycomics.com/">Christiann</a> and her sister&#8217;s stuff, especially the hilarious <a href="http://www.teneastread.com/products/">tshirts!</a> It&#8217;s hard to believe it&#8217;s their first show, as they&#8217;re both so talented!  We attempted to go to the after party but it was a crowded room in a nonsensically frat bar-ish place, so we left.</p>
<p>On Sunday I bought most of my goods.  I picked up Hope Larson&#8217;s latest book, <a href="http://books.simonandschuster.com/Mercury/Hope-Larson/9781416935858">Mercury</a> which is, so far, excellent, I love Hope&#8217;s flowy art style.  I also had brought Flight 4 (my favorite of the Flight books) with me and got <a href="http://goraina.com/">Raina Telegmeir</a>, <a href="http://www.yaytime.com/">Dave Roman</a>, and <a href="http://scott-c.blogspot.com/">Scott C</a> to sign it!  Thanks for obliging everyone!  While I was at the <a href="http://www.doublefine.com/comics/Scott_C/">Double Fine</a> table, I pestered Scott C (he&#8217;s a very friendly guy!), gave him a mini, and bought a <a href="http://postercabaret.com/theflyingswingbyscottc.aspx">beautiful print</a> that I&#8217;m saving for the new apartment.  I also picked up some nice prints in a trade with our friends at the <a href="http://tapirtooth.blogspot.com/">Tapir Tooth</a> table&#8230; Then I traded with <a href="http://miriamgibson.com/">Miriam Gibson</a> for a hilarious mini from her <a href="http://www.centauraday.com/">Centaur-A-Day</a> blog!  Continuing trading a few tables down, I traded my mini for <a href="http://fromthewell.info/">Neil Brideau&#8217;s</a> Trugglemat mini.  It was well put together, and I love that heavily crosshatched inky look!  Thanks!  I also traded with <a href="http://alisaharris.blogspot.com/">Alisa Harris</a> for an adorable mini called Counter Attack!  She tells me she&#8217;s working on an upcoming webcomic that sounds very exciting called <a href="http://cookingupcomics.com/">Cooking up Comics</a>.  It&#8217;s a vegetarian webcomic and, <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/2009/02/10/its-just-pork/">being a vegetarian myself</a>, am really looking forward to this one!  While I was in that area, I also checked out <a href="http://www.friedwontons.com/index/">Megan Baehr&#8217;s</a> amazing <a href="http://www.friedwontons.com/index/nonesuch">dolls</a>.  They&#8217;re pricey but so detailed and very gorgeous.  One day, one day!  Heading <a href="http://cookingupcomics.com/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-878" title="carrots-cookingup" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/carrots-cookingup-300x211.jpg" alt="Alisa Harris' Cooking up Comics" width="240" height="169" /></a>back to my table I picked up David McGuire&#8217;s beautiful first <a href="http://www.gastrophobia.com/index.php">Gastrophobia</a> book, <a href="http://www.gastrophobia.com/store.html">The 12 Labours of Gastrophobia</a>.  He drew a cute black widow spider inside!  At the same table, I traded <a href="http://ensho.net/">Tina Pratt</a> for her latest issue of <a href="http://paul-reveres.com/">The Paul Reveres</a> and bought 1 &amp; 2 so I can force my friends to read it.  I also picked up <a href="http://paul-reveres.com/?page_id=246">Willie&#8217;s bandana</a>, which is stylish and totally matched my outfit that day.  Lastly I traded for a comic by Max Ink called <a href="http://blinkcomic.wordpress.com/">Blink FYI IDK</a>.  We also drew his own characters in his sketchbook!  That&#8217;s a good idea&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh man was MoCCA gigantic, amazing, and tiring.  Sort of like this news post (*hands fall off*)!  I probably missed some people, but I&#8217;m down and out for now.  Please be sure to look for your favorite NERDs at our next con on May 15th-16th&#8230;<br />

It&#8217;s going to be my first planned out con (ie one I didn&#8217;t learn about 2 weeks ahead of time)! I&#8217;ll have pins, card [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-525" title="spxbanner" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/spxbanner.jpg" alt="spxbanner" width="385" height="50" /></p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s now (kind of) a month away, I thought I&#8217;d like to let you all know I&#8217;ll be attending <a href="http://www.spxpo.com/">Small Press Expo</a> in Bethesda, Maryland on September 26 and 27th.  It&#8217;s going to be my first planned out con (ie one I didn&#8217;t learn about 2 weeks ahead of time)!</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-526" title="milkcover" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/milkcover.jpg" alt="milkcover" width="147" height="205" />I&#8217;ll have pins, card sets, and art for sale (and maybe a new non-related to The GU mini too, if I have time), but the big news is that my first book will be out!  That&#8217;s right, The Glass Urchin 1: Milkshakes &amp; Highways compiles the first 139 comics, including the complete <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/2009/06/16/senior-year-1/">New Brunswick Saga</a>!  That&#8217;s right, read it all before it&#8217;s out!  I&#8217;m working on the pricing for everything now, but I should have plenty at my table at a variety of price ranges.</p>
<p>As usual I will be sharing my tablery with fellow <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/">NERD</a>, <a href="http://www.sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/">Bree</a>.  A couple of my webcomicking friends will be at SPX too, like Jamie of <a href="http://www.suddenvalley.org">Sudden Valley</a> and <a href="http://www.dernwerks.com">Darren</a> of <a href="http://www.dernwerks.com/HWC/">Hello With Cheese</a>.  And of course there will be tons of other talented people.  Hope to see you there!</p>
