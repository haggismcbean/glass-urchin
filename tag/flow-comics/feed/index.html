				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday&#8217;s NY Comicker meet up was a blast!  A bunch of regulars showed up which is always rgeat, and we also met some new people.  Many comics were created, and I decided to start collecting these comics into a Flickr pool so we can see all the different styles and sessions as we have more meetings.  See the whole set <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auilix/sets/72157623091033497/">HERE!</a> I also uploaded some older stuff from MoCCA and NY Comicon to the set.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auilix/4276221323/in/set-72157623091033497/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-742" title="flowcomic" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/flowcomic.png" alt="" width="256" height="100" /></a><br />
Yesterday&#8217;s art and comics were created by some of the following people:<br />
<a href="http://sexdrugsandjunecleaver">Bree</a>, <a href="http://tapirtooth.blogspot.com/">Miriam</a>, <a href="http://fleen.com">Gary</a>, <a href="http://www.notquitewrong.com/rosscottinc/">Ross</a>, <a href="http://www.rayuen.com/">Ray</a>, <a href="http://www.inhislikeness.com/">Jamie</a>, <a href="http://www.clairemation.com/">Claire</a>, <a href="http://www.loldwell.com/">Caldwell</a>, <a href="http://www.johnnywander.com/">Yuko &amp; Ananth</a>, and myself.  Although I couldn&#8217;t really tell you who did what except for my own panels, breeruption panels, and Ray&#8217;s quirky stuff. </p>
