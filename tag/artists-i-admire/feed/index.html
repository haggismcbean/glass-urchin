				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like any modern comicker, there are a lot of artists I&#8217;ve admired and followed throughout my life.  I&#8217;d like to take a little bit of time to thank those artists that have inspired me and continue to do so every day.  I hope I&#8217;ll be able to update this from time to time and be a little bit informative as well.</p>
<p>One of my earlier influences, and probably one that a lot of comic artists can relate to, is <a href="http://www.boneville.com/">Jeff Smith</a> who wrote and drew the amazing and now classic adventure graphic novel, Bone.  He also went on to do other great comic and non-comic work such as Shazam!, RASL, and Little Mouse.  Like most people my age (and hopefully lots of new generations thanks to the full color reprints!), we&#8217;ll probably always hold his first great work, Bone, close to our hearts.</p>
<p>I could gush on and on about Jeff Smith&#8217;s amazing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0FC9hmBm08&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=B64C93DA26B44C82&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;playnext=1&amp;index=38">ability of inking</a>, his great contributions to the world of comics, or his uncanny ability to meld comedy and drama in the most unlikely of packages&#8230;  But that&#8217;s all been done before.  We all know Jeff Smith is a wonderful storyteller, and time and time again has shown us dynamic and unique characters with amazing range of expression and depth.  Like many other fans out there, I look forward to each new RASL adventure, and any new hint of projects soon to come.</p>
<p>Where Jeff Smith really inspired me was his sheer willpower.  Back when I was first introduced to Smith through that fateful Disney Adventures issue back in 1994, I had a vague inkling of the comics industry as an unstoppable terror of brute force.  Comics I loved, like Uncanny X-Men, had artists and authors who were so far away from anything I could do or think of myself, that I felt far removed from ever entertaining the thought of doing them myself.  With Jeff Smith in his self-published <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-903" title="bone-hot" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/bone-hot.png" alt="" width="108" height="123" />book that he wrote and drew himself, my ten-year-old-self saw someone I could relate to.  Here was someone who believed in his own story, who created and guided his ow characters, and who put it all together in one beautiful comic book.  I was surprised and instantly hooked.  I would go to our local comic store monthly (even though back then Bone came out once every other month), and I would ask about the new issues of Bone.  Something about that rarity, the unsteadiness of Smith&#8217;s publishing schedule, the &#8220;underground&#8221; feel of his comic brought me closer to him.  I rejoiced upon each new issue brought into my hands and despaired when he went on hiatuses, of which it seemed there might be no return.  It was like an emotional whirlwind for my younger self, but Smith didn&#8217;t fail to disappoint even as he began finishing the series when I was nearing my twenties.</p>
<p>Now of course, we couldn&#8217;t imagine Bone having finished any other way.  The Bone<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-902" title="ben" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ben-189x300.jpg" alt="Grandma Ben, one of my favorite Bone characters (isn't it hard to choose?)" width="122" height="194" /> one volume edition is a gorgeous work and a <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1951793_1952069_1952915,00.html">true storytelling masterpiece</a>, but on one aspect I feel it fails a little.  Smith&#8217;s ten long years of hard work goes almost unnoticed under its pages, which flow from one to another with the same ease as Smith&#8217;s own pen.  Of course, this is just as well!  It makes for a greater story, and Jeff Smith has shown all of us how to make a story really great.  But I&#8217;d like to thank that other side of Smith as well, the side that struggled with the story and pages and labored under the publishing deadlines.  The Smith who set up tiny tables manned by himself at cons who had that drive that only a self-publisher could.  Thank you for teaching me that comics don&#8217;t only take talent, artistry, and a good narrative, but also that comics take patience, drive, and endurance.</p>
<p>I hope one day I can thank Jeff Smith in person for all the inspiration he&#8217;s given me and countless others&#8230;  For now I&#8217;ll have to settle with sending him a letter and my first book, which I have him (among others) to thank for.  I also made him this fanart &#8211; an ode to two of my favorite comic artists ever:<br />
