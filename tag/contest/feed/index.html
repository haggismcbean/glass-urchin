				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh mai!  Check out my entry to <a href="http://nedroidcomics.livejournal.com/">Nedroid&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://nedroidcomics.livejournal.com/209714.html?mode=reply">&#8220;Win a Date with Reginald&#8221;</a> contest!!  I totally threw Mike out of a panel in the first strip.  It&#8217;s kind of like defenestrating him, only with panels, not windows.  </p>

<p>What do you think doods?  This was my first time using brush pens and bristol board!!  It was really a lot of fun.  I was trying to break my habit of taking ten years to do each panel&#8230;  From concept to finish, I would guess this took probably 3-4 hours.  I enjoyed trying out the bristol board, and the ink brush was fun too (although it was a fake one &#8211; just a micron with a brush tip, not an acutal brush).  In terms of topic, this was a lot more off the wall than what I usually do, cause this time, it&#8217;s all made up!  Which is always fun to do, and take a short break from my real-life type comics.   </p>
<p>I hope I win.  I&#8217;m a big fan of Nedroid&#8217;s little robot dude!</p>
