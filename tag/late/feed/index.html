I shan&#8217;t be making excuses for lack of updates, merely I&#8217;ll explain what&#8217;s happening in my life thus far. It&#8217;s been nothing exciting, nothing especially comic worthy in any case, but it&#8217;s been hard work. For the past couple of months, I&#8217;ve been working as hard as I can updating my portfolio and demo reel and working on new projects and burning through as many tutorials and books as I can get my hands on and my mind around. The job-hunt-of-sorts has really been consuming almost everything I have. Every time I take a break, I berate myself for not going down the list of things that I need to do: why haven&#8217;t I written that new cover letter? Why haven&#8217;t I started that tutorial on nHair driven joints in Maya? Why haven&#8217;t I perfected the shading group of my character&#8217;s render in mental ray on the background I made? My resume is a month old, why haven&#8217;t I updated the format?</p>
<p>Yeah. I don&#8217;t think this will ever be done until I get a job, and I feel guilty working on things that won&#8217;t eventually get into the portfolio. So until then, which for my mental sake I hope is soon, expect to see sporadic updates as in the past couple of months on GU. </p>
<p>Thanks as always for reading!</p>
