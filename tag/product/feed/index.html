				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys, so I apologize for not yet posting any recaps for <a href="http://interventioncon.com/">Intervention</a> or <a href="http://www.spxpo.com/">Small Press Expo</a> yet, it was a super busy weekend and a busy subsequent week!  I promise you&#8217;ll see something up soon on here and <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/">NERD Comics</a>.  In a nutshell, it was a great weekend and was a lot of fun meeting new fans and comickers and hanging out with old friends.</p>
<p>I just wanted to take the time to let you know that there&#8217;s been a bunch of new product I&#8217;ve been working on but due to the <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/">NERD Comics</a> shop being a bit under the weather (should have it up this month or so), I haven&#8217;t been able to post them anywhere online.  If you are interested in anything you see here, please feel free to send me an email and I&#8217;ll see if I can arrange something via paypal as a temporary solution!  I know a lot of you have been asking at cons and stuff, so I thought I should at least post something.</p>
<p>First up, I have two t-shirts (one charcoal and one turquoise) in my 2Player &lt;3 Style, available in girl&#8217;s and boy&#8217;s sizes from Small to XL.  One can be yours for $20 each!  Some of these I screenprinted myself!  I had a lot of fun with this design and it went over well at the cons it debuted at this summer.</p>
<p><a href="/glass-urchin/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2Plove.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1178" title="2Plove" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2Plove-300x259.png" alt="" width="300" height="259" /></a></p>
<p>Next, some brand new acrylic earrings!  These are really adorable, and the pictures I took don&#8217;t really do them any justice.  I made two designs &#8211; one incorporating the classic SNES controllers to go with the 2P Love shirt, and the other incorporating ME!  That&#8217;s right you can have two cute hedgepogs dangling off your ears for only $12 a pair!  Or if you buy a pair each of the controllers and the hedgehogs, I&#8217;ll give them to you for $20.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/?p=1105"><img title="Darwin" src="http://www.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/darwin-264x300.png" alt="" align="left" /></a>The last new product I have available is actually a NERD collective product- our very first anthology, Darwin!  <a href="http://www.sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/">Bree</a> and I put these books together and we both contributed stories in it.  You can check out some small clips of it, as well as further information a list of the talented artists and writers who joined us <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/?p=1105">here</a>!</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</span></p>
<p>Aaaaanyway, hopefully good sales can continue online as my scanner just broke.  It&#8217;s going to be difficult posting comics, but you know I&#8217;ll find a way to keep them coming!</p>
