				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday&#8217;s NY Comicker meet up was a blast!  A bunch of regulars showed up which is always rgeat, and we also met some new people.  Many comics were created, and I decided to start collecting these comics into a Flickr pool so we can see all the different styles and sessions as we have more meetings.  See the whole set <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auilix/sets/72157623091033497/">HERE!</a> I also uploaded some older stuff from MoCCA and NY Comicon to the set.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey all!  <a href="http://www.sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/">Bree</a>, <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/dingle/">Foley</a> and myself (otherwise known as the three wise <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/">NERDs</a>) have been doing a New York Comicker meetup every now and then for the past half a year.  Are you in New York?  Do you read/write/draw indie comics or webcomics?  Do you just love drunken flow comics?  If so, you should come join us at the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/12th-street-ale-house-new-york">12th Street Ale House</a> on the Lower East Side this <strong>Thursday at 7pm</strong>.  The Ale House is located on 12th Street and 2nd Avenue, and is a great venue because they have huge tables, not terribly loud music, good drink specials, and you can bring in food from anywhere nearby!</p>
<p>Mainly we sit around, talk shop, draw and drink!  There are several comic pages passed around usually and we talk about news and upcoming cons and network with new people.  Some others who have participated include <a href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/">Darwin Carmichael is Going to Hell</a>, <a href="http://tapirtooth.blogspot.com/">Tapir Tooth</a>, and Gary of <a href="http://fleen.com/">Fleen</a>.  Come join us!</p>
