I myself had a tube of that stuff, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I wasn&#8217;t actually playing the &#8220;real&#8221; game.  Ridiculous game.  I don&#8217;t think this applies to most things (cartoons, movies, music, RADICAL fashion), but collectible games nowadays, like Bakugan, are way cooler than the 80s/90s equivalents.  Oh but if I was a pog, I would definitely be an awesome holographic SLAMMER!  Maybe with an eight ball on it, or even a skull!</p>
<p>PS &#8211; it looks like I drew <a href="http://www.fleen.com/">Gary</a> on the hedgeblog panel <img src='http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well probably a lot of you know me and my friends in real life, or have at least seen me at a con or two.  But if you haven&#8217;t &#8211; we&#8217;re all real people, though it might be hard to imagine, given my character design&#8230;  Have you ever wondered about those real people?  Since this is the closest thing I can think of as a &#8220;spoiler&#8221; in my comic, I&#8217;m hiding it behind the jump. <br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe it&#8217;s from the owning of a hedgehog, or maybe it&#8217;s because I draw a comic starring a hedgehog, or maybe I just like funny little spike-asses, but I have come across (and own) a lot of hedgehog-related items.  I thought it would be interesting to share some of these pog finds, so I took pictures of some of the stuff here!  <img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-637" title="IMG_3267" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3267-150x150.jpg" alt="IMG_3267" width="145" height="145" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-636" title="IMG_3265" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3265-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_3265" width="219" height="292" /> First up is this &#8220;<strong>Haribou</strong>&#8221; character that Mike won me from our trip to Japan.  This guy must have been sorta famous, we saw him (and some other more pink hedgehogs) in UFO catchers while we were there.  I guess he must be a character in a show or something.  The hangtag has a little comic of something, but I don&#8217;t care!  Go Japan for getting a much closer-to-the-real-thing hedgehog!  Sorta.  For some reason, you can take his spikes off!  But it&#8217;s an <a href="http://uglyoverload.blogspot.com/2009/03/spud-mystery-of-tiggywinkles.html">established fact</a> that hedgehogs just don&#8217;t look this cute with their spikes off&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-638" title="IMG_3272" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3272-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_3272" width="262" height="197" /></p>
<p>Next up we have this little DIY-charmer.  Mel gave this to me &#8211; it was a little pom pom kit with the pom poms all already made and beady eyes as a finishing touch.  Unfortunately, my glue wasn&#8217;t so great so he&#8217;s a little worn at the edges.  But still, it was a fun little urchin-related kit!</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-639" title="IMG_3295" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3295-150x150.jpg" alt="IMG_3295" width="150" height="150" />Then we have these really cute fall-themed hedgehog napkins my<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-640 alignright" title="IMG_3296" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3296-150x150.jpg" alt="IMG_3296" width="140" height="140" /> friend Cori found unexpectedly at her parents home (she sent some to me by mail).  Really adorable!  I kind of wonder why anyone would put hedgehogs on autumn (thanksgiving???) napkins, seeing as how most Americans don&#8217;t even know what a hedgehog is.  Maybe they&#8217;re European napkins or something.  One side has two hedgehogs snuggling and the other side is a mommy and a baby hedgehog!!  So cute.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-641" title="IMG_3273" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3273-150x150.jpg" alt="IMG_3273" width="150" height="150" />Lastly in the stuffed toys area, Harry gave me this cute hedgehog stuffed toy!  This one is pretty accurate to your average hedgehog-shape.  It also has a tiny baby hedgehog/alien that pops out of the mom&#8217;s tummy!  But I jammed the zipper and so the baby is kind of currently stuck inside the mommy (and thus unavailable for a photograph).  But it&#8217;s cute too!  Trust me.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-642" title="IMG_3270" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3270-150x150.jpg" alt="IMG_3270" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>And I saved the best for last.  This bottle of Italian red wine I found at Trader Joe&#8217;s (in Union Square) a couple of weeks ago.  I&#8217;m not even sure what <em>kind</em> of red wine it is, the label just says &#8220;Vino Nobile Di Montepulciano&#8221; and &#8220;Incanto&#8221; at the bottom.  It sounds like wine-related wizarding spells to me.  And tastes sort of average&#8230;  I&#8217;m really not good at judging wine other than to know if it tastes good or horrible (and it doesn&#8217;t taste horrible).  But let&#8217;s zoom into that label!!!</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-643" title="IMG_3271" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_3271-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_3271" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>OMG it&#8217;s HEDGEHOG WINE!  This wins hands down as my favorite wine bottle ever (even above that cute bottle Tara showed me a couple months ago with a funny dog on it).  Awesome!  Thankfully, it does not taste of real hedgehog (which I would imagine would involve meal worms, cat food, and poop).</p>

Actually it&#8217;s easy to see why&#8230;  The 30 Rock location seems very bright and airy, whereas even the good floors in the actual 30 Rock are quite dark.  But it was quite shocking news that 30 Rock doesn&#8217;t film there.  And so instead of Tina Fey, I got Rachel Ray.  Damn you NBC!!!</p>
<p>Just kidding.  My visit there was a lot of fun!  It was very exciting to see all the news people at work.  We went into Brian Williams&#8217; set and we saw Keith Olberman getting a hair trimming.  We popped into a taping of the Jimmy Fallon show (a segment about cooking with Rachel Ray as the guest), and then she almost got in our elevator (stepped in and was alerted that the elevator was going up, not down).  We watched live rehearsals of SNL in the deck above the SNL floor &#8211; we saw all of the cast and Justin Timberlake!  And Brian Williams passed us in the hallway.  </p>
<p>Thanks Mel for the NBC studio tour!</p>

	<p><a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/2009/05/05/cereal-alchemy/"><img src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/comics/2009-05-05-090_cerealalchemy.png" border="0" alt="Comic" /></a></p>			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The perfect bowl of cereal in the morning is the way I start most of my days (I occasionally try to pretend like I&#8217;m healthy, and I eat oatmeal instead).  And at any given time, I&#8217;d say I usually have 3-6 boxes of different cereals for optimal Cereal Alchemy.  What&#8217;s your favorite combination?  I love to stick something heavy, like Frosted Mini-wheats on the bottom to soak up some milk, while I have something more sugar-punchy on top, like Cocoa Pebbles or Smacks, and for a better balance, I try to throw in something like puffed wheat or other more generic flavored cereal.  But of course I get bored easily and I cycle out my cereal boxes more often than any other food I eat!  </p>
<p>And if you couldn&#8217;t read my cereal titles in the first panel, and cause I wasted such time thinking of them, they are &#8211; &#8220;Jackelhare&#8217;s Tricky Bites for Children,&#8221; &#8220;Straw-stack Tufts,&#8221; &#8220;Sir Capt. C. Crunch&#8217;s Pillowy Crunches,&#8221; &#8220;Checkered Squares,&#8221; &#8220;Samson&#8217;s Fruit Circles,&#8221; &#8220;Ye Olde Flakes,&#8221; &#8220;Lunatic Bird&#8217;s Chocolate Balls,&#8221; &#8220;Sweetened Turnabout Rounds,&#8221; and &#8220;Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler&#8217;s Fibrous Ones&#8221; (&#8217;cause only someone as terrible as CMOT Dibbler could create a cereal as horrible as Fiber One).  </p>

But, like our hedgehog brethren, I am more bark than I am bite really.  Literally, all these three individuals, who know me best of all, pointed it all out within the same couple of days&#8230;  Don&#8217;t worry guys&#8230;  I complain a lot but I&#8217;m not all that bad!  </p>
<p>&#8230;Except for those stupid tourists, I could knock one of those guys off no prob!  ;P</p>
<p>BTW &#8211; did you notice my awesome new font?  I dub it &#8220;Auilix&#8217;s Occasional Hand,&#8221; and it&#8217;s basically my own handwriting!  What do you think?  More or less annoying than the previous font?</p>

I swear!  </p>
<p>Now I tried to really convey how I feel about this, but it only ended up looking funny.  But I really do cry almost every time I go into a Victoria&#8217;s Secret, because the store clerks promptly ignore me and my flat chest, and they never have my size or anything that remotely fits.  I know it&#8217;s just a silly little thing to get emotional over, but I guess we all have our own little personal things about ourselves we hate.  The worst part about it is that I love their styles and bras and would gladly snap them up if I could fit into a one!  </p>
<p>But alas no.  If Victoria had her way, she&#8217;d make those scant few privileged and perfected-boob-ed folks the envy of the world!  Oh well, she already has&#8230;   </p>
<p>Although I meant this to be really personal and such, and it ended up looking very silly, I still enjoy this one a lot.  I think it&#8217;s one of my faves in recent memory.  Hmm&#8230; Do you think I&#8217;m spending too much time on bras and boobs?  </p>
