<p>I showed Shivi and the dudes asking that question, but I actually get it a lot.  I guess telling people you &#8220;make toys&#8221; is kind of ambiguous, but toy production is very different from design.  It&#8217;s still quite creative and probably varies from company to company but I did a lot of hands on stuff from beginning to end (to put it simply).  But when it&#8217;s time to go, it&#8217;s time to go.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been a fan of Apple products.  I like to look at them and their advertising, and I&#8217;m sure I would love to have some if they weren&#8217;t so expensive (I did receive an iTouch once, and I promptly sold it because I was in dire need of money).  But the iPhone is one of the few Apple products that actually look like it&#8217;s worth it to have, rather than a &#8220;would be nice&#8221; category that most iPods fall under.  If I got one though, I think I might go crazy with my compulsive e-mail and website state checking that I might never be able to leave the net ever again.  I need not tell you what those things can do!</p>
<p>In other words, all that iPhone power would probably get to my head, and I might destroy the world.  So for now, I remain a mere mortal &#8211; people like Dylan and Heather can use and abuse the power while people like Bryan and myself watch on, amazed.  </p>
