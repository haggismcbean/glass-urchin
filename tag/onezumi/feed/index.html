I do have some problems related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</a> (or was it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia">hyper?</a>  things i need to see the doctore about&#8230;), but for the most part it only occurs rarely on days where I have an abnormal eating schedule.  But this time it was a mite more powerful than usual and, much to everyone (esp. <a href="http://www.fleen.com">Gary&#8217;s</a>) chagrin, I do not <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/2009/04/07/getting-older-and-lookin-classy/">vomit gracefully</a>.  Thanks very muchly to Gary and Sue (who just happened to be at the restaurant too) of the Metuchen First Aid Squad, who were there to deal with my sudden loss of feeling/vision/the contents of my stomach.</p>
<p>I tried to base Gary&#8217;s character off his <a href="http://twitpic.com/knrrq">pup</a>, who I have not yet had the pleasure to meet!  Maybe next NJ Webcomic Chaos!  Also, Zumi&#8217;s in this comic and was in a previous comic around this same time last year!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.onezumi.com/"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v305/auilix/zumiguest_thumb.jpg" align="right" alt="gasp!"></a>What&#8217;s <a href="http://www.onezumi.com/">Onezumi</a> gasping about here?  Find out in my guest comic to Onezumi!!  This was based off a Twitter conversation from a while ago about the continued mis-pronunciation of her name (even though it&#8217;s written right on her shirt!).</p>
<p>Onezumi is a fun <a href="http://www.onezumi.com/">comic</a> that used to be crazy and random, and is now crazy and random with a continuing plot and storyline.  Where will the adventures of Onezumi, Harknell, and Ass Munkey take us in the depths of the Deathside?  </p>
<p>Onezumi as a <a href="http://www.onezumiverse.com/">person</a> is also crazy and random and a lot of fun.  She&#8217;s a pillar in the webcomic community and is continuously supporting other webcomics, no matter how small, and encouraging people of all different art, style, and themes to join in.  She&#8217;s been a real inspiration to me to make The Glass Urchin, and through her I met some other great webcomickers who are talented and supportive (<a href="http://www.artfighthighschool.com/">The AFHS guys</a>, <a href="http://dernwerks.com/dearpirate/">Dern</a>, and <a href="http://www.suddenvalley.org/">Jamie Baldwin</a> to name a few).  Her hubbie and webmaster Harknell makes <a href="http://www.awsom.org">Awsom.org</a>, a neat resource of tutorials and extra plug-ins for the webcomic and art community to use.  Please check Onezumi and Harknell out!  </p>
