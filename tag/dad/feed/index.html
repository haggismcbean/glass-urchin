Dad tells me a lot more of his light-hearted stories than Mom, mainly because he enjoyed playing pranks and tricks on people throughout his life.  This one above is one of his favorite stories to tell of his time in the French Army.  </p>
<p>I have to say, panel #7 was my most favorite panel I&#8217;ve done in a long time.  It was cracking me up the whole time.  As always, all of my comics are true, including this one.  I wonder if there are a couple of French dudes out there who remember getting chased through the woods by a crazy man with a rifle because they didn&#8217;t know the &#8220;password&#8221; to get into the base.  Panel #2 kind of reminds me of something you would see in Beetle Bailey hahaha.  </p>

<p>By the by, I&#8217;ve been trying to improve my art lately, and one of the things I&#8217;m proudest of is learning how to do proper speech bubbles!  It was beginning to annoy me!  But thanks a lot to a simple tutorial that I found linked from some other webcomic, I found the secret to great bubbling.  The tutorial can be found <a href="http://www.goodshipchronicles.com/tutballoon.php">here</a>, on a webcomic called Good Ship Chronicles, so you too can make fine speech bubbles.  </p>

I just try to keep my head down when stuff like this happens &#8211; no use starting an Italian dressing vs Sesame Ginger war in the kitchen.</p>
<p>On a side, I&#8217;m trying to go for my original idea with this comic and have more slice-of-life-ish comics, rather than comics with a punch line (not that I have many of those, they just seem to be trying to go in that direction).  What do you think?  More chill, not-necessarily-having-a-point comics?  Or do you just want a sunday funnies-esque punch in the face of jokeage?  Or (*gasp*) a continuing storyline!?  </p>

We do talk, but not usually things regarding emotion or opinion, so I tend to think that dad and I might not be as close as we should be.  I do remember being much closer when I was younger, but I&#8217;m not sure if anything really happened to make us distanced.  Anyway, maybe that&#8217;s just the way he is.  </p>
<p>This story is one he recalled to me not too long ago, about when I was little (and had to follow dad into the men&#8217;s room all the time).  See!  Even back then I wanted to be a boy!  I guess though, I was just surprised that dad would recall a story about me like that with clarity- that he shared a chuckle with a stranger over me wanting to use a urinal.  It seemed like he even had the dialogue down pat &#8211; the accent by the way is an attempt to portray my dad&#8217;s way of speaking&#8230;  He was born and raised in France and while it is a French accent, it&#8217;s also a little weird.  </p>
<p>I think this might just be a story about how I want a penis.  </p>
