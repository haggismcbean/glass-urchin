<p>I showed Shivi and the dudes asking that question, but I actually get it a lot.  I guess telling people you &#8220;make toys&#8221; is kind of ambiguous, but toy production is very different from design.  It&#8217;s still quite creative and probably varies from company to company but I did a lot of hands on stuff from beginning to end (to put it simply).  But when it&#8217;s time to go, it&#8217;s time to go.</p>

I know Heart Gold/Soul Silver are just remakes of a series that has basically stayed the same since the beginning, but I just love starting out a new Pokemon journey.  Gets me everytime!  I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the collecting aspect or the building-up your team aspect, but it&#8217;s just one of those ones that I&#8217;ll play anytime (but screw those other offshoot Pokemon games, they&#8217;re lame).</p>
<p>I think we all have something we need to dork out about.  I&#8217;m not just saying it HAS to be about dorky things &#8211; it can be anything from your love of Coruscant architecture to letterboxing to Final Fanasty potions to baseball&#8230;  Everyone has something they know and love really well.  And I think if you hit upon the subject with people, it might come blasting out like a gusher.  </p>
<p>And I literally was playing Pokemon while I was drawing and coloring this &#8211; Plain Badge get!!!</p>

Maybe once in a while, but this guy was obviously too drunk to care.  Oh Shivi, why do you always attract the weirdos?  </p>
<p>And some people might recognize this bar, we trekked far and long down confusing streets of Queens to get there on a terribly cold winter day&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, Shivi insists this guy wasn&#8217;t that weird looking but hey that&#8217;s how I remember him!!!</p>

<p>So while drawing this page I was too lazy to actually go outside my apartment to draw it.  Panel #2 was brought to you in part by Google Maps, in which you can find disturbingly close shots of my current apartment (and every other apartment I&#8217;ve lived in in Jersey City), which is located across from the Grove Street PATH station.  SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT IT NEXT TIME!  (ya weirdo!)</p>
