				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wish this was a post introducing a line of cuddly real-life stuffed hedgehog toys, but alas you&#8217;ll have to do with the next best thing &#8211; Ami starring as a very cute plushy iteration in the webcomic <a href="http://www.plusonecomic.com/">Plus One</a>!!!  She (I?) makes her stitched debut <a href="http://www.plusonecomic.com/2011/07/ami-the-hedgehog/">here</a>, as the titular character&#8217;s new toy!  Plus One is an endearing webcomic about an interesting and new life journey.  And hey, just like it was recently Anna&#8217;s birthday, it was also the birthday of The Glass Urchin a couple of days ago, so this comes as a nice GU birthday treat!  Thanks Dustin!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it seems I haven&#8217;t really updated this bloggish type area in a long while!  Over a month (just a little!).  Many apologies.  Things have been going on and it&#8217;s crazy times.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s new in my life?  I&#8217;ve been fostering a <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=12990229">cute stray calico</a>; experimenting with new kinds of art involving ink brushes, bristol paper, and tones (so check out updates to my <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/a-gallery/">art gallery</a>); and last weekend I got to hang with webcomicker Ross of <a href="http://www.notquitewrong.com/rosscottinc/">The System</a> and some old and new friends all night long.  I&#8217;ve generally been quite busy and between the kitty and Frey&#8217;s running wheel breaking down and squeaking all night, I&#8217;ve also had a huge lack of sleep.  So if my comics have been terse or sparse, now you know why!</p>
<p>In other news, I apoligize for not sharing these great fanart-type pieces with you sooner!  From <a href="http://spiffy-keen.com/">Shade</a> comes a beautiful xmas gift <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/a-gallery/?px=%2FGlassUrchinFanart%2Fxmas_hedgie_byshade.jpg">illustration</a> (love the bristly painted look and texture!), from friend and previous co-worker <a href="http://rayuen.com/">Ray</a> comes a piece on the other end of the spectrum with hard lines and tones that&#8217;s <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/a-gallery/?px=%2FGlassUrchinFanart%2Frayfanart.jpg">cute and simple</a>, and from webcomicker <a href="http://jhorsley3.com/">Jhorsley</a> of <a href="http://y2clcomic.com/">Y2CL</a> comes a neat <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/a-gallery/?px=%2FGlassUrchinFanart%2Fglassurchinfanart_byjhorsley.jpg">fanart</a> drawn on the back of a comic page!!  Thanks all!  They&#8217;re freakin&#8217; awesome!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh mai!  Check out my entry to <a href="http://nedroidcomics.livejournal.com/">Nedroid&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://nedroidcomics.livejournal.com/209714.html?mode=reply">&#8220;Win a Date with Reginald&#8221;</a> contest!!  I totally threw Mike out of a panel in the first strip.  It&#8217;s kind of like defenestrating him, only with panels, not windows.  </p>
<p>Click on the image below to see the big picture:<br />

<p>What do you think doods?  This was my first time using brush pens and bristol board!!  It was really a lot of fun.  I was trying to break my habit of taking ten years to do each panel&#8230;  From concept to finish, I would guess this took probably 3-4 hours.  I enjoyed trying out the bristol board, and the ink brush was fun too (although it was a fake one &#8211; just a micron with a brush tip, not an acutal brush).  In terms of topic, this was a lot more off the wall than what I usually do, cause this time, it&#8217;s all made up!  Which is always fun to do, and take a short break from my real-life type comics.   </p>
<p>I hope I win.  I&#8217;m a big fan of Nedroid&#8217;s little robot dude!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.onezumi.com/"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v305/auilix/zumiguest_thumb.jpg" align="right" alt="gasp!"></a>What&#8217;s <a href="http://www.onezumi.com/">Onezumi</a> gasping about here?  Find out in my guest comic to Onezumi!!  This was based off a Twitter conversation from a while ago about the continued mis-pronunciation of her name (even though it&#8217;s written right on her shirt!).</p>
<p>Onezumi is a fun <a href="http://www.onezumi.com/">comic</a> that used to be crazy and random, and is now crazy and random with a continuing plot and storyline.  Where will the adventures of Onezumi, Harknell, and Ass Munkey take us in the depths of the Deathside?  </p>
<p>Onezumi as a <a href="http://www.onezumiverse.com/">person</a> is also crazy and random and a lot of fun.  She&#8217;s a pillar in the webcomic community and is continuously supporting other webcomics, no matter how small, and encouraging people of all different art, style, and themes to join in.  She&#8217;s been a real inspiration to me to make The Glass Urchin, and through her I met some other great webcomickers who are talented and supportive (<a href="http://www.artfighthighschool.com/">The AFHS guys</a>, <a href="http://dernwerks.com/dearpirate/">Dern</a>, and <a href="http://www.suddenvalley.org/">Jamie Baldwin</a> to name a few).  Her hubbie and webmaster Harknell makes <a href="http://www.awsom.org">Awsom.org</a>, a neat resource of tutorials and extra plug-ins for the webcomic and art community to use.  Please check Onezumi and Harknell out!  </p>

Hopefully will be getting more too.</p>
<p>Shown here on the left is an amazingly detailed piece by <a href="http://www.redcoatcat.com/">RedCoatCat</a> through a Secret Santa fanart exchange on the <a href="http://tomgeeks.com/phpBB/index.php">Tomgeeks Forum</a>.  She claims she&#8217;s never drawn a hedgehog before, but she sure did get down their awkward bodies and tiny paws very well.  Thanks so much Red!  <a href="http://www.redcoatcat.com/">RedCoatCat</a> also does an amazing retelling of the American War of Independence on <a href="http://loyaltyliberty.com/">Loyalty &#038; Liberty</a>.  All the characters are historically accurate and are depicted beautifully in feline form, please check it out.   </p>
<p>And if YOU have any fanart for me, no matter how big or small, I&#8217;d love to hear from you!  Drop me a line here: auilix (at) gmail.com.  </p>
