It&#8217;s fun to draw people sometimes&#8230;  Sometimes I think I get a little carried away because they show up so rarely in my own comic!  I had fun drawing Bree&#8217;s Gaia character &#8211; I like her old school desi<a href="http://happyhourcomic.com/?p=1229"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1110" title="happyhrguest" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/happyhrguest.png" alt="" width="103" height="184" /></a>gn!  Please do read through the archives of MWI when you get there as it&#8217;s a fun and quick read.  I hope to see more Gaia soon too!</p>
<p>I also forgot to post this but I did another guest comic (involving people too! &#8230;but also cute fluffy animals) for a fellow New Jerseyan and Rutgers alum who does the long-running webcomic and print comic <a href="http://happyhourcomic.com/">Happy Hour!</a> Jim was celebrating his 1000th comic!  Wow!  Glass Urchin still has a long way to go.  But you can see the comic I did for him <a href="http://happyhourcomic.com/?p=1229">here</a>!  Please check it out if you have time!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So a lot of shit has happened to me since I started this comic <a href="/glass-urchin/2008/07/01/the-beginning/">two years ago</a>.  Not only has my art changed quite a bit, but so has my life!  I&#8217;ve lived in five different places since I started this, had two different and weird jobs, plus two periods of unemployment, made tons of toys, and played god knows how many video games.  Life has all taken us far, and I wanted to thank you, the reader, for sticking with me this whole time.  I sometimes wonder why I do what I do, but I&#8217;ve gotten so much support lately, not just from friends and family, but from readers who really care.  It&#8217;s really flattering!  (not that the unique hits you give me isn&#8217;t flattering!)</p>
<p>So next week I have a nice treat planned out &#8211; updates and comics from characters from The Glass Urchin!  That&#8217;s right, the real people who have been in this comic will be making their own comic stories and it&#8217;ll be a week-long GU celebration.  It&#8217;ll also give me some much needed rest, after which I&#8217;ll be back again with updates and fun in the second week of July.</p>
<p>Want to see what little sister Mel wrote about me in her diary?  How about the exciting &#8220;art&#8221; Harri and I saw last month?  Tune in next week for those comics and more!</p>

I&#8217;m writing this through teary eyes right now, because my hand is going to freakin&#8217; fall off and I have nothing to even show for all the work I did.  </p>
<p>But a golden (greyscale?) ray of hope shines on in the form of this great guest comic by <a href="http://www.sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/">bree!</a>  Bree is awesome.  Because she totally saved my butt by giving me this guest comic which I saved for a day such as this.  This is just a conversation we had back when we both actually had time to take lunches together&#8230;. Ah those good ol days when I didnt work every waking moment of the day&#8230;.</p>
<p>By the by, if you ever wanna drop me a guest comic, you can go right ahead at auilix (at) gmail!</p>
