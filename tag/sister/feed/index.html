				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/art/melyeah.jpg" align="right">Happy Birthday to little sister Mel!  Party hardy tonight and tomorrow!<br />
I would&#8217;ve had a nice Mel-comic up today, which I started to draw, but when I asked her about it for approval, she said I shouldn&#8217;t do it.  Something about it portraying her in a crazy stalker light or something like that.  Perhaps you will see it, someday in the future.  Anyway, for now you&#8217;ll just have to get this doodle then, it&#8217;s of our Mel-pog, being spikey.  Hope you have a fun and exciting birthday, Mel!  I know it&#8217;s been the most difficult and stressful of times, from the workload, your sprained knee, and our loss of little Ash.  But I know, if there&#8217;s anyone who can hang in there, it&#8217;s you.  Birthday happy yo!</p>
