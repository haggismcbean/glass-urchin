The two gals of <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/">Nerd Comics</a> (yours truly and the wonderful <a href="http://sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/">bree</a>) are going to Meredith Gran&#8217;s <a href="http://www.webcomicsweekend.com/">New England Webcomics Weekend</a>.  It was just so crazy we had to go, and we got lucky and were able to find a car in the nick of time (many thanks to Mom and little sis <img src='http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> )!  So we&#8217;ll be there, but unfortunately only on Saturday.  It&#8217;ll be good times I&#8217;m sure, meeting up with good friends and making some new ones!  If you&#8217;d like to meet, please get my contact information by e-mailing me!  It&#8217;s auilix (at) gmail.com!  (By the by, woohoo!  That&#8217;s me on the right.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve posted a picture of me here yet.  Don&#8217;t I look just like I do in the comic!?  It&#8217;s uncanny!)</p>
<p>And some great upcoming events that are closer to home are rearing their head, this on by <a href="http://www.onezumiverse.com/">Onezumi</a>: <a href="http://www.onezumiverse.com/?p=2388">NJ Webcomic Chaos!</a>  You can be sure us Nerd gals will be there as well!</p>
<p>Also, hello to all the new people who have been coming to my site.  I hope you&#8217;ll stick around and enjoy yourselves here!  </p>
