I guess it was pretty predictable that the streets would be full of them- I loved the Joker and Batman this summer as well, but it seemed like it was just asking to be overdone on Halloween.  </p>
<p>Anyway sorry for the delay in this comic &#8211; I intended to post this up sooner, but from all the craziness of last week, I had to put it off.  I&#8217;m trying to get back on schedule with the comics, so hopefully that will happen sometime within the next couple of weeks haha&#8230;</p>
