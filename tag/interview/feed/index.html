				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bree and I had an awesome weekend at <a href="http://www.brooklynlyceum.com/">Brooklyn Lyceum&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.kingconbrooklyn.com/">KingCon</a>, thanks to all who stopped by!  I think Bree summed up the craziness that was this past weekend with this (very real) comic about how it made us accidentally run in the <a href="http://www.sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/2010/11/08/11082010/">NY Marathon</a>.  Anyway it was great meeting all of you, and sorry if I seemed out of it &#8211; it&#8217;s just the usual con wear and tear.  Rifling through the stuff I picked up, I met <a href="http://www.megan-brennan.com">Megan Brennan</a>, who I traded for a cute mini &#8220;Melvin Lampius Saves the Day!&#8221; (I love the art and colouring style!), <a href="http://www.mmm-hmm.com">Kevin Shelley</a>, who had a beautifully presented book called Mmm-Hmm, <a href="http://firstlawofmadscience.com/">Mike Isenberg</a>, who I had met at NYCC but then met again at KingCon and who gave me a sample of his book, <a href="http://glitchworks.com/">Tim Piotrowski</a> who had beautiful new editions of his great book about the Kool Aid Man, <a href="http://www.thelindo.com/">Sara and Steve</a>, who I should have realized earlier were from my neck of the woods (sorry!), and <a href="http://www.jamietanner.com/">Jamie Tanner</a>, whose work is just beautiful (I need to buy me some prints next time).  Phew!  We also hung out with some of our good friends who do <a href="http://tapirtooth.blogspot.com/">Tapir Tooth</a>: <a href="http://andreatsurumi.com/">Andrea</a>, <a href="http://www.miriamgibson.com/">Miriam</a>, <a href="http://www.peterquach.com/">Peter</a>, and Blu-jay, as well as our usual crowd of comic and art friends.  Gah!  Sorry if I forgot anyone!</p>
<p>We were also interviewed by <a href="http://jimmyaquino.typepad.com/">Jimmy Aquino</a> at <a href="http://www.comicnewsinsider.com">Comic News Insider</a>, and the full interview, plus interviews with other talented artists at the con can be heard <a href="http://www.jimmyaquino.typepad.com/comicnewsinsider/2010/11/episode-303-king-con-with-abede-lovelace-bree-rubin-ami-bogan-fred-chao-jamie-tanner-jonathan-baylis.html">here</a>!!!  He interviewed Bree and I as well as some other talented folks who tabled at <a href="http://www.kingconbrooklyn.com/">KingCon</a>.  He also picked up a copy of my first book and gave it a really nice review nearing the end of the podcast.  Please give it a listen!</p>
