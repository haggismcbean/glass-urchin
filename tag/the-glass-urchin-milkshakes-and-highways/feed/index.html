It&#8217;s going to be my first planned out con (ie one I didn&#8217;t learn about 2 weeks ahead of time)! I&#8217;ll have pins, card [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p>Since it&#8217;s now (kind of) a month away, I thought I&#8217;d like to let you all know I&#8217;ll be attending <a href="http://www.spxpo.com/">Small Press Expo</a> in Bethesda, Maryland on September 26 and 27th.  It&#8217;s going to be my first planned out con (ie one I didn&#8217;t learn about 2 weeks ahead of time)!</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-526" title="milkcover" src="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/milkcover.jpg" alt="milkcover" width="147" height="205" />I&#8217;ll have pins, card sets, and art for sale (and maybe a new non-related to The GU mini too, if I have time), but the big news is that my first book will be out!  That&#8217;s right, The Glass Urchin 1: Milkshakes &amp; Highways compiles the first 139 comics, including the complete <a href="/glass-urchin/2009/06/16/senior-year-1/">New Brunswick Saga</a>!  That&#8217;s right, read it all before it&#8217;s out!  I&#8217;m working on the pricing for everything now, but I should have plenty at my table at a variety of price ranges.</p>
<p>As usual I will be sharing my tablery with fellow <a href="http://www.nerdcomics.com/">NERD</a>, <a href="http://www.sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/">Bree</a>.  A couple of my webcomicking friends will be at SPX too, like Jamie of <a href="http://www.suddenvalley.org">Sudden Valley</a> and <a href="http://www.dernwerks.com">Darren</a> of <a href="http://www.dernwerks.com/HWC/">Hello With Cheese</a>.  And of course there will be tons of other talented people.  Hope to see you there!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m trying to put out a compilation book on all the pages, plus the entire New Brunswick Saga in completion, by this September.  Can I do it?  We shall have to see.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m looking for quotes.  You know, the quotes you see on the back of the book or in the dust jacket of books.  Like something related to how you feel about The Glass Urchin, things like &#8220;a spik√©d tour de force&#8221; and other artsy things that you&#8217;re never really sure of what they mean, but they sound good and make you want to read more.  Answer in the comments here if you have anything to input, and I might choose yours!  I&#8217;ll probably select only a couple of quotes (planning on also putting a bit of a summary/introduction on the back), but any and all quotes are welcome!  If you have a URL to your webcomic, put that as well.  If you don&#8217;t have a webcomic or company, you could always make up something up!  Negative comments, if you want to be a big meanie, are welcome too.</p>
<p>You might see <i>your</i> quote on the very first book of The Glass Urchin!!!</p>
