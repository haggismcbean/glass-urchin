				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wish this was a post introducing a line of cuddly real-life stuffed hedgehog toys, but alas you&#8217;ll have to do with the next best thing &#8211; Ami starring as a very cute plushy iteration in the webcomic <a href="http://www.plusonecomic.com/">Plus One</a>!!!  She (I?) makes her stitched debut <a href="http://www.plusonecomic.com/2011/07/ami-the-hedgehog/">here</a>, as the titular character&#8217;s new toy!  Plus One is an endearing webcomic about an interesting and new life journey.  And hey, just like it was recently Anna&#8217;s birthday, it was also the birthday of The Glass Urchin a couple of days ago, so this comes as a nice GU birthday treat!  Thanks Dustin!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I&#8217;ve decided to slightly delay the Thursday update.  Since the beginning, I have been updating in the early am of Tuesday and then the early am of Thursday.  However, I realize that only gives the Tuesday comic two business days of being up (cause really, we know everyone looks at comics most at work!), the Thursday comic being up for the rest and the weekend.  So from now on I think I&#8217;ll try to upload the Thursday comic sometime in the evening hours, so as to let the Tuesday comic have about half of the spotlight.</p>
<p>And as for our sponsors, The Glass Urchin doesn&#8217;t really have any!  But I have been looking into linking to webcomic lists and databases, please do suggest one if I haven&#8217;t already joined it.  You can now find me on <a href="http://www.frumph.net/">Frumph Net</a> and <a href="http://www.drunkduck.com/The_Glass_Urchin/">Drunk Duck</a> (although I don&#8217;t really understand how that site works).  If you have time, please click on through to Frumph (and any links I post hereafter) to give me a boost in stats.  Much obliged!</p>
<p>*<span style="color: red;">Edit</span>*  Please also click on <a href="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com">The Webcomic List</a> or use the links at the bottom of the page to boost my rankings, if you&#8217;ve got a spare moment in your day!!  The more you do, the more likely it is I&#8217;ll appear on an ad with that site.  Thanks guys!</span></p>
