<p>Katy is really fun and cool and she let me stay over her place in Japan for some days, which was so much fun!  I&#8217;m envious of her insane talent with music &#8211; she casually picked up the accordion while in Japan and the songs she played for us were so beautiful.  Thanks Katy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So a lot of shit has happened to me since I started this comic <a href="http://glassurchin.nerdcomics.com/2008/07/01/the-beginning/">two years ago</a>.  Not only has my art changed quite a bit, but so has my life!  I&#8217;ve lived in five different places since I started this, had two different and weird jobs, plus two periods of unemployment, made tons of toys, and played god knows how many video games.  Life has all taken us far, and I wanted to thank you, the reader, for sticking with me this whole time.  I sometimes wonder why I do what I do, but I&#8217;ve gotten so much support lately, not just from friends and family, but from readers who really care.  It&#8217;s really flattering!  (not that the unique hits you give me isn&#8217;t flattering!)</p>
<p>So next week I have a nice treat planned out &#8211; updates and comics from characters from The Glass Urchin!  That&#8217;s right, the real people who have been in this comic will be making their own comic stories and it&#8217;ll be a week-long GU celebration.  It&#8217;ll also give me some much needed rest, after which I&#8217;ll be back again with updates and fun in the second week of July.</p>
<p>Want to see what little sister Mel wrote about me in her diary?  How about the exciting &#8220;art&#8221; Harri and I saw last month?  Tune in next week for those comics and more!</p>
