**The internet is a scary place.** It feels like every week there's a new story about some massive company spying on me. Google [downloads listening devices on user's machines](http://thehackernews.com/2015/06/google-chrome-spying.html), Facebook can now [recognise you in photos even if your face is obscured](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/33237459/facebook-working-on-tech-that-recognises-you-even-if-your-face-is-unclear), both companies track your movements [across the](http://www.sitepronews.com/2014/09/29/new-facebook-ad-service-track-users-across-web/) [web](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/google-tracks-consumers-across-products-users-cant-opt-out/2012/01/24/gIQArgJHOQ_story.html) and in [real](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/22/google-android-and-apple-track-your-location_n_852529.html) [life](http://rt.com/news/facebook-app-track-location-510/).

You could argue that none of this really matters because all these companies are doing is targeting ads, and you have ad block. Will ad block always shield you from all ads? Probably not. Ads are going to become more embedded and harder to avoid. When they do I don't want to be watching (they'll be videos) ads that address me by name, or ads that make me feel guilty for being out of shape, or just in general any ads that play on **me specifically**. 

On those grounds, it's time to take back your privacy!

##Here's how:

###Install Firefox

[Chrome is evil](http://lifehacker.com/5763452/what-data-does-chrome-send-to-google-about-me). Firefox is a much worse browser, but at least you can be sure you're being looked after. If you really cannot do without Chrome, think about [Iron Browser](https://www.srware.net/en/software_srware_iron.php) (Chrome without the tracking)

###Install Noscript

Javascript is a great way for websites to track you. Incidentally, also a great way for websites to install malicious things onto your machine. [Noscript](https://noscript.net/) blocks javascript from running and you allow individual scripts on trusted websites. You'll need some computing knowledge to know which scripts to allow. If you don't have any I recommend allowing scripts with 'cdn' in the name, and blocking scripts that reference vague networks or large corporations.

###Install Ad Block

[Duh](https://adblockplus.org/)

###Install Ghostery

[Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) is pretty cool I just found out about it the other day. Basically it blocks things like cookies and those 1px images that spy on you. I think it also blocks javascript tracking, but it's nice to have Noscript just to be doubly sure. 

###Make HTML DuckDuckGo your default search engine

Not as good as Google for most things, however it's [not following your every move](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy). 

###Stop Using GMail and Google Drive

There aren't many good alternatives to GMail other than setting up your own email. Use a domain and then register with [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/mail/). For Google drive, [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) is probably fine.

###If you have to use Facebook or Google based products, use the html version

I use Facebook still. Pretty hypocritical. Whatever man sometimes it's hard not to be a hypocrite if you're trying to be selfless or good or stand up for something worthwhile. (Egs : I'm vegetarian but love eggs and milk. I believe in charity and equality but spend money on myself rather than sharing it out.) I use Facebook, but I use the mobile version. m.facebook.com. It makes it more annoying, so I Facebook less, so that's good. Also they can't track me as easily. Same with gmail - although soon I'll set up my own email server. Just need to buy a domain first
